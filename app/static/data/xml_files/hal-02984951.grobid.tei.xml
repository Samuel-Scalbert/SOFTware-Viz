<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Agents use ontologies to represent their knowledge of the world. Generally, these ontologies are not the same. This causes a problem when agents try to communicate: how do the agents understand each other if they express their knowledge in different ways? This question is part of the more general problem of facilitating interoperability between agents while preserving heterogeneity in their information. Ontology matching algorithms have been developed to allow agents with different knowledge representations, structured in ontologies, to communicate <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. These aim to find relationships holding across entities of two ontologies, the ontology alignment.</p><p>Alignments are typically computed and provided as input to the agents before any communication or joint task occurs.</p><p>Ontology matching algorithms may output only partially correct or incomplete alignments. This means that, even if alignments are available, communication failures can still occur due to mistakes in the alignment. There have been several attempts to repair ontology alignments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> that have been integrated with multi-agent systems via specific protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. In these approaches, alignment repair is performed statically, i.e. independently of agent interaction. However, in some multi-agent scenarios, it is not realistic nor desirable for agents to stop interacting until the repair is completed. This is why several approaches to ontology matching have been proposed that attempt to dynamically repair alignments <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. The Alignment Repair Game (ARG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> that is inspired by ideas of cultural language evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> is one of them. In ARG, the agents are adaptive: they communicate and, in parallel, evolve alignments through local corrective actions whenever communication fails. This is achieved via adaptation operators that specify precisely how agents adapt the failing correspondence of the alignment.</p><p>ARG was evaluated experimentally and the experiments showed that the adaptive agents converge towards successful communication and improve their alignment <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. However, experiments alone are not sufficient to logically assess properties of operators; whether they are correct, complete or redundant. In this paper we introduce a formal framework based on Dynamic Epistemic Logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> to answer this question. This contributes to (1) providing a formal framework for knowledge and belief evolution for logical agents in ARG, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> formally defining correctness, redundancy and completeness of the adaptation operators, (3) theoretically comparing adaptive agents and logical agents and (4) defining new adaptation operators.</p><p>Yet, the scope of this theoretical framework is not limited to ARG: it can be extended to establish formal properties of other games that are designed for agents to improve and repair alignments through interaction. This would allow for a theoretical comparison of different dynamic matching algorithms.</p><p>In the remainder, we discuss the related work ( §2) and provide the preliminaries ( §3). We introduce DEOL ( §4) and translate states of ARG to DEOL models ( §5). The formal properties of the adaptation operators are then proved ( §6). We conclude by emphasizing the contribution to the broader dynamic ontology matching field ( §7). violations to agents' ontologies via conservativity principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. These have been integrated with multi-agent systems via specific protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>. However, they are performed independently of agent tasks.</p><p>To overcome this problem, interaction-situated semantic alignment was proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This is an ontology matching algorithm as framed by the interaction protocols used by agents to communicate. Alignments are induced depending on repeated successful interactions and failing interactions lead to revision. This proposal was further advanced to repair alignments through their use and generalized to less constrained protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</p><p>The Alignment Repair Game (ARG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> is inspired by cultural language evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> to repair alignments through their use. Cultural language evolution offers an experimental methodology in which language (or more generally: culture) is shared amongst a population of agents and evolves through local corrective actions whenever communication fails. ARG adapts this methodology to the evolution of ontology alignments and experiments showed that the adaptive agents converge towards successful communication through local corrective actions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</p><p>The purpose of this paper is to examine the corrective actions performed by adaptive agents in ARG from a logical perspective. We introduce a formal framework based on Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) to compare adaptive agents to logical agents, and we prove the logical limitations of the adaptation operators proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. The logic introduced here is an extension of the work on Epistemic Description Logics <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. DEL has been widely used as a framework to reason about information flow in multi-agents systems and has been applied communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, belief revision <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and agent interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">PRELIMINARIES</head><p>In this section, we first explain what are ontologies and ontology alignments ( §3.1), then we describe the Alignment Repair Game as a way for agents to evolve alignments ( §3.2) and give the syntax and semantics of Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL) ( §3.3). This logic is the basis for the logic introduced later in this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Ontologies and ontology alignments</head><p>An ontology provides a vocabulary of a domain of interest and a specification of the meaning of terms via semantic relations: specialization (Ď), equivalence ("), exclusion (') and membership (P) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Formally, an ontology can be expressed as a knowledge base in Description Logics <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. The definition we use in this paper is that an ontology is defined as a that are not disjoint) we also write C ≬ D and in each ontology J is the class such that J I " ∆. From classes C, D, we also form the classes C \ D, C [ D and ␣C that represent the union, intersection and complement of C (and D). In this paper, the signature of an ontology is the set of class names C P C and object names o P D.</p><p>An alignment A ab between two ontologies O a and O b with (generally) different signatures is a set of correspondences between classes of the two <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Formally, such a correspondence is a triple xC a , C b , Ry where C a and C b are class names of O a and O b , respectively, and R P tĎ, Ě, ", 'u is a relation that is asserted to hold between C a and C b . We also write C a RC b for xC a , C b , Ry.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Alignment Repair Game</head><p>The Alignment Repair Game (ARG) is a protocol designed for adaptive agents to evolve alignments between their ontologies through their use <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. The aim of ARG is to detect and repair mistakes in alignments whenever a communication failure occurs through application of the adaptation operators. The idea is that ultimately, by repeatedly playing ARG, the alignments converge towards better alignments.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 3.1 (Adaptation Operator</head><p>). An adaptation operator provides a strategy for agents to revise the failing correspondence of the alignment. It specifies, given the failure of the correspondence xC a , C b , Ry with R P tĚ, "u and failing object o, what the agents should do. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>  From the definition, every operator entails delete, the operators add, addjoin, refine and refadd entail replace and refadd entails addjoin and refine. Furthermore, the order of the actions that are performed by the adaptation operators does not matter. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> illustrates the effect of the adaptation operators. Definition 3.2 (Alignment Repair Game). The Alignment Repair Game is played by a set of agents A with a common set D of objects. Each agent a P A is associated with an ontology O a and a set tA ab u of non-empty alignments is given between any two ontologies O a and O b that at least includes J a " J b . We write O i P O i for the most specific class (Ď-wise) of object o P D available in O i .</p><p>At each round of the game:</p><p>(1) Two agents a, b P A and an object o P D are picked at random.  </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">J a Ď Ď ' D a Ď C a Ď o J b C b Ď Ď D b Ď Ď ' Ě Ď (replace) Ě (add) Ě (addjoin) Ě (refine)</formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">(3) Agent a compares C a with O a . If O a ⊨ O a Ď C a , then</formula><p>the round is a success, else the round is a failure and an adaptation operator α xC a ,C b ,Rypoq is applied to A ab .</p><p>ARG consists of a fixed number of rounds as described above for a chosen operator.</p><p>As an illustration of one ARG round consider Example 3.3 that will serve as a running example throughout this paper. Note that each class in the ontology corresponds to the conjunction of the class label and the label of its ancestors. For instance, the bottom-leftmost class in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> is defined by Square a [ Small a . The initial alignment A ab is represented by the dotted red correspondences between classes of their ontologies. Now, consider two cases: the object ▲ and the object △. Let in both cases agent a ask agent b to which class the object belongs in her ontology so that it can be translated to O a via the alignment. In both cases, agent b will answer Small b as both objects belong to this class in O b . However, while for the object ▲ the round would be successful (because ▲ P Black a ), for the object △ a failure is reached (because ▲ P W hite a and W hite a ' Black a ).</p><p>In the latter case α xBl ack a ,Small b ,"yp▲q is applied to the alignment A ab . An ARG state is the state of the alignments reached after a, possibly empty, sequence of rounds where in each failing round an adaptation operator is applied.</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">J b O b Small b Larдe b Ď Ď ' Square b Trianдle b ▲, △ Ď Ď ' Square b Trianдle b Ď Ď ' J a O a Black a W hite a Ď Ď ' Small a ▲ Larдe a Ď Ď ' Small a △ Larдe a Ď Ď ' " "</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 3.4 (ARG State).</head><p>For an ARG game with a set A of agents, a set tO i u iPA of ontologies and a set tA i j u i,jPA of alignments, an ARG state tA 1 i j u i,jPA is the set of alignments A 1 i j reached from tA i j u i,jPA after a, possibly empty, sequence of rounds.</p><p>For an ARG state s, we also write α xC a ,C b ,Rypoq psq for the result of applying the adaptation operator α to s with failing correspondence C a RC b and object o, or simply αpsq when the correspondence and object are clear from the context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 3.5 (Running Example).</head><p>In case of a failure of the correspondence Black a " Small b , an adaptation operator is applied, adding the following new correspondences to the alignment and deleting the initial correspondence:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">‚ delete: none ‚ replace: Black a Ď Small b ‚ add: J a Ě Small b ‚ addjoin: J a Ě Small b ‚ refine: Black a Ě pSquare b [ Small b q ‚ refadd: J a Ě Small b and Black a Ě pSquare b [ Small b q</formula><p>By playing ARG with different operators, they can be compared. In Euzenat <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, the operators are compared experimentally in terms of success rate (ratio of successes over rounds played), semantic precision and recall with respect to the known correct reference alignment (the degree of correctness and completeness of the resulting alignment) and convergence (the number of rounds needed to converge). It was found that all the operators have a relatively high success rate, yet do not reach 100% precision, and that recall and convergence both increases with operators that add new correspondences. The operator refadd, followed by add, shows the highest semantic recall and replace, again followed by add, the slowest convergence.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Dynamic Epistemic Logic</head><p>Dynamic Epistemic Logics (DEL) are a family of modal logics describing information flow in multi-agent systems. DEL has been widely used as a formal framework to model agent communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, belief revision <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and agent interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. As such, it provides a solid basis to study knowledge and belief evolution of logical agents playing ARG. Here we consider the syntax and semantics introduced by Baltag, Moss and Solecki <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Definition 3.6 (Syntax of DEL). The syntax, L DEL , of (multiagent) DEL is defined in the following way:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">ϕ ::" p | ϕ ^ψ | ␣ϕ | K a ϕ | B a ϕ | r †ϕsψ</formula><p>where p P P is a proposition, K a and B a are the knowledge and belief operators for each agent a and †ϕ with † P t!, Òu the dynamic upgrades.</p><p>The connectives _ and Ñ, and the duals Ka , Ba , x †ϕy are defined in the usual way: ϕ _ ψ iff ␣p␣ϕ ^␣ψ q, ϕ Ñ ψ iff ␣ϕ _ ψ , Ka ϕ " ␣K a ␣ϕ, Ba ϕ " ␣B a ␣ϕ, and x †ϕy " ␣r †ϕs␣ψ . DEL models are based on Kripke frames with plausibility relations where the logical dynamics act as model transformers.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 3.7 (DEL Model).</head><p>A model of (multi-agent) DEL is a quadruple M " xW , pě a q aPA , w ˚, V y where ‚ W is a non-empty set of states, or worlds; ‚ pě a q aPA Ď W ˆW are the plausibility relations on W , one for each agent, that are converse well-founded, locally connected preorders; ‚ w ˚P W is the actual world; ‚ and V is a propositional valuation mapping propositions to sets of worlds in which that proposition is true.</p><p>The plausibility relation w ě a v reads as "w is at least as plausible as v for agent a" and the epistemic and doxastic relations are defined on W accordingly:</p><p>w</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">" a v iff w pď a Y ě a q v (1) w Ñ a v iff v P Max ď a |w| a (2)</formula><p>where |w| a is the information cell (or accessible cell) of agent a at state w and is defined by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">|w| a " tv P W | w " a vu<label>(3)</label></formula><p>It follows from the properties of ď a and ě a that the relations " a are reflexive, transitive and symmetric, and the relations Ñ a are transitive, serial and Euclidean.

For this reason, conservative upgrades only change the plausibility of worlds without deleting any alternatives.</p><p>Note that in all cases, w ˚remains the actual world of the model. This also means that an announcement !ϕ can only be validly performed on a model M if ϕ is true there.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DYNAMIC EPISTEMIC ONTOLOGY LOGIC</head><p>To compare adaptive agents with logical agents, we need a logical framework to model ARG. Here, we introduce Dynamic Epistemic Ontology Logic (DEOL) that is a variant of Dynamic Epistemic Logic where the propositions are object classifications (Cpxq) and class relations (C " D, C Ď D and C ' D) of a Description Logic language. This logic enables us to later capture knowledge and belief evolution in alignment repair. Definition 4.1 (Syntax of DEOL). The syntax, L DEO L , of (multiagent) DEOL is defined in the following way:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">ϕ ::" Cpoq | CRD | ϕ ^ψ | ␣ϕ | K a ϕ | B a ϕ | r †ϕsψ R P tĎ, ", 'u, † P t!, Òu</formula><p>where C, D, J P C, o P D, K a and B a are the knowledge and belief operators for agent a and †ϕ with † P t!, Òu are the dynamic upgrades.</p><p>The connectives Ñ and _ and the duals Ka , Ba , x †ϕy are defined as in the case of DEL.</p><p>DEOL models are plausibility models. The difference with DEL models is that instead of a valuation of propositions, we consider a domain of interpretation ∆ representing the objects and an interpretation function I assigning to each world a function interpreting each class as a set of objects of the domain.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 4.2 (DEOL Model).</head><p>A model of (multi-agent) DEOL is a quintuple M " xW , pě a q aPA , w ˚, ∆, I y where ‚ W is the set of states, or worlds; ‚ pě a q aPA Ď W ˆW are the plausibility relations on W , one for each agent, that are converse well-founded, locally connected preorders; ‚ w ˚P W is the actual world; ‚ ∆ is the domain of interpretation (a set of objects);  </p><formula xml:id="formula_11">‚</formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">M, w ⊨Cpoq iff o I w P C I w M, w ⊨C Ď D iff C I w Ď D I w M, w ⊨C " D iff C I w " D I w M, w ⊨C ' D iff C I w X D I w " H</formula><p>The additional capacities of logical agents compared to the original game are that logical agents can now use the relations between concepts to reason about instance classification. For instance, the following axiom schemata are valid:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">K a pCpxqq ^Ka pC Ď Dq ñ K a pDpxqq<label>(4)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_14">K a pCpxqq ^Ka pC ' Dq ñ K a p␣Dpxqq<label>(5)</label></formula><p>In addition, agents can combine their knowledge and beliefs to obtain new beliefs. For instance, K a pC a poqq and B a pC a Ě C b q entails B a pC b poqq. In other words, agent a can transfer some of her knowledge about C a to beliefs about C b . This increased reasoning capacity of logical agents compared to adaptive agents is crucial in the results later about the correctness, partial redundancy and incompleteness of the adaptation operators.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">TRANSLATION</head><p>In the previous section, we have provided a formal framework for knowledge and belief evolution in alignment repair. We now use this framework to capture the Alignment Repair Game. More precisely, we define a translation from ARG states to DEOL axioms that are interpreted as sets of DEOL models ( §5.1) and from adaptation operators for ARG to dynamic upgrades on DEOL ( §5.2), see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">3</ref>. These translations are labeled by z and δ , respectively, and the interpretation on DEOL models by I . This enables us to define and prove correctness, redundancy and completeness of the adaptation operators in the remainder of this paper.  In the interpretation on DEOL models, this means that the sentences that describe O a are true in any world in |w ˚|a , and the sentences that describe A ab are true in all most plausible worlds in both |w ˚|a and |w ˚|b .</p><p>Example 5.1 (Running Example). In the running example, this means that the sentences pSquare a [ Small a q Ď Small a , Small a Ď J a , Trianдle a [ Small a p▲q, etc, are true in every accessible world for agent a and that the sentences Small a " Black a and J a " J b are true in the most plausible worlds for both agents. Formally, this is achieved on the interpretation on DEOL models by ultimately making as many copies of the worlds describing the agent's knowledge and belief as there are combinations of the alternatives above, ranking them all equally plausible while respecting the order imposed by the alignments.</p><p>Because models rapidly explode, we will only draw the information given by the ontologies and alignments.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Dynamics</head><p>During the gameplay of ARG, new information is learned. There are two dynamic acts involved in the learning: the communication of C b poq in step 2 of ARG and the adaptation operator applied in step 5 (see Definition 3.2). How do these acts change the knowledge and beliefs of the agents?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.1">Correctness</head><p>To show that the adaptation operators are correct, we need to show that the diagram of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">3</ref> commutes.

This is because add can force false correspondences to be added to the alignment that can later cause a failure.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.2">Redundancy</head><p>The redundancy of some operators in the running example is not a coincidence. For logical agents, i.e. DEOL agents, some adaptation operators are redundant for every ARG state: delete, replace and addjoin are redundant with respect to agent a and refine is redundant with respect to agent b. Before we define this redundancy with respect to one agent (partial redundancy), let us first consider what it means for an operator to be redundant (with respect to both agents). An adaptation operator α is redundant if and only if solely applying !C b poq on the DEOL translation of s is already sufficient to obtain an interpretation of the DEOL translation of αpsq. The adaptation operators discussed here are not redundant, but partially redundant. This means that they are redundant with respect to one agent. To prove redundancy, we show that the knowledge and belief of this agent are invariant to the application of the adaptation operator. In fact, because adaptation operators only alter the beliefs of agents, it suffices to show partial redundancy by showing that the beliefs of that agent remain unchanged. Proof. We do the proof for agent a and the adaptation operator addjoin. The proof for replace now follows because it is entailed by addjoin, and the proof for refine is symmetric.</p><p>Thus we need to show that pzpsqq !C b poq ⊨ B a ϕ implies that zpaddjoin xC a ,C b ,Ěypoq psqq ⊨ B a ϕ. So consider a sentence ϕ that is not believed by agent a in zpaddjoin xC a ,C b ,Ěypoq psqq, but is in zpsq. By construction of the dynamics of the operator addjoin, this can only be ( <ref type="formula">1</ref> However, none of the adaptation operators are redundant with respect to both agents. Even the simple delete carries valuable information to agent b: namely that the initial correspondence fails. Without this operator, agent b would not be aware whether the round of ARG is a success of a failure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.3">Incompleteness</head><p>Finally, we consider completeness of the adaptation operators: do the operators capture all the information that can be learned? Intuitively, this is proven by comparing what is learned by the agents in ARG scenarios from application of the adaptation operators with what is learned by logical agents in DEOL from the dynamic upgrades. If the former implies the later, the operator is (epistemically) complete. Definition 6.7 (Completeness). Adaptation operator α is complete if and only if @s: zpαpsqq ⊨ pzpsqq δ pα q . Proposition 6.8. All adaptation operators (delete, replace, add, addjoin, refine, refadd) are incomplete.</p><p>Proof. Again, consider the knowledge and belief of agent a before and after the announcement !C b poq, see also Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">7</ref>. After the announcement !C b poq, agent a receives concrete information that object o belongs to the class C b , i.e. she comes to know this information: pzpsqq !C b poq ⊨ K a pC b poqq. And, by definition, this knowledge remains after application of any conservative upgrade, i.e. pzpsqq δ pα q ⊨ K a pC b poqq. Yet, this knowledge is never acquired through application of the adaptation operators because they only concern the alignment, i.e. beliefs of class relations, and not knowledge of instance classification. Hence zpαpsqq ⊭ K a pC b poqq and zpαpsqq ⊭ pzpsqq δ . □</p><p>The incompleteness proof of the adaptation operators relies on the agent not memorizing the failure of the correspondence with the drawn object. Yet, from Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_21">7</ref> it is clear that there is more knowledge gained by the agents from the announcement !C b poq. This occurs because we measure completeness, and correctness, with respect to the full knowledge and belief of the agent. When concentrating on the alignment only, as expressed by adaptive agents, the operators may be complete.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</head><p>We developed a theoretical framework for knowledge and belief evolution in ARG and formally defined correctness, completeness and redundancy of adaptation operators to compare adaptive agents and logical agents. We complement the current experimental approach by proving that, in this framework, all but the add operator are correct, delete, replace, addjoin and refine are redundant for one agent and that all operators are incomplete. This contributes to theoretically comparing the different operators and could inspire new adaptation operators for ARG. However, this does not mean that the adaptive agents are meaningless. In fact, the adaptive agents in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> implement deliberately a 'sublogical' behavior and the experiments show that, in some cases, they can perform well. For instance, agents do not need to be fully complete, and not even fully correct, to reach 100% success in ARG. The purpose of our work is to examine them under a logical light. We compare adaptive agents to logical agents, and we prove the logical limitations of the adaptation operators.</p><p>Yet, the scope of this paper lays beyond ARG. We have provided a theoretical framework that can be extended to establish formal properties of other games that are designed for agents to improve and repair alignments through interaction. This allows for a theoretical comparison of different dynamic matching algorithms.</p><p>In this paper, public signature awareness was a prerequisite in the translation from ARG states to DEOL to capture the dynamics of the game by announcements and conservative upgrades. In the future, we want to drop this prerequisite. We suspect that this might provide the means to capture the ability to generate new (random) correspondences <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>quintuple O " xD, C, Ď, ', Py where D is a set of objects, C is a non-empty set of class names, Ď, ' Ď C ˆC are the semantic relations, and P Ď D ˆC is the membership relation.
