<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The place of individuals and the control of their data have emerged as central issues in the European data protection regulation. The "empowerment" of the individual has notably resulted in the recognition of a new prerogative for the individual: the right to the portability of personal data.

On the strength of these technical and legal innovations, several questions arise: what forms of empowerment are targeted in practice?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>While the world is being turned upside down by Artificial intelligence and the use of personal data, the place of individuals and control over their data have become central issues in the new European Data Protection Regulation that came into force in May 2018. The European Union's intention with this regulation was to social sciences and forms the basis of individual empowerment. It was coined by Martha Nussbaum and Amartya Sen <ref type="bibr">15</ref> , then further developed by Ruth Alsop <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">16</ref> and Deepa Narayan <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">17</ref> . Personal agency characterises individual empowerment through two key components: the individual's "ability to envisage options and make a choice" <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">18</ref> and "the capacity to transform choices into desired actions" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">19</ref> . According to these authors, the concept of personal agency can be used to characterise various vectors of empowerment related to human development, poverty reduction and women's status improvement.</p><p>We argue in this paper that this concept can be transposed to personal data management, to offer a new reading of empowerment measures in this context. Hence, our point is to extend the statements made by Tim Berners-Lee, winner of the Turing Award, criticising the current situation of the Web and the monopolies it engenders in personal data management. Now working on a new PIMS solution, he uses the concept of personal agency as the key to empowering individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">20</ref> ("you will have far more personal agency over data"). <ref type="bibr">21</ref> Based on its initial meaning, personal agencytransposed to the context of personal data management by individualscould be said to rest on two pillars.</p><p>(1) The first aim is to enable all individuals to "make decisions" about their own data. On one hand, this requires a range of different options to be open to the individual, as promoted by portability which allows migration from one service to another. On the other hand, individuals should not only be able to give their consent and hence to access necessary information (e.g. in the general terms of use for services that process their data), but also to understand it (e.g. by adequately designing information to ensure educated consent). In other words, they should be capable of measuring the effectsand the risksentailed by their decisions around the use of their data, especially by considering each party's responsibilities. Such are the required conditions to ensure informed decision-making.</p><p>(2) Each individual should be in a position to "become an agent" of the way their decisions are implemented, i.e. to be able to orchestrate how their data is processed and ensure that this complies with their decisions. Varying scales of control and safeguards can be argued for, bearing in mind that delegation of control is not always sufficient to secure personal agency <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">22</ref> . In essence, the digital ecosystem where individuals with personal agency evolve would enable them to confidentially compute and deduce certain appropriate information from subsets of their personal data and to transmit this information to third parties of their choice, with means to proove to said third parties that the information was indeed produced by the individuals, using given computation codes applied to given personal data subsets. The underlying IT architecture and the levels of protection offered to individuals and third-party services with whom they interact should therefore be carefully considered to uphold personal agency. This definition being established, our goal is to further investigate the meaning of personal agency and identify key conditions to empower individuals regarding Big Data features. Therefore, personal agency should be broken down according to the particular types of decision and use at stake. These may be divided into two main groups: exclusively individual uses related to a single person's data (often referred to as Personal Big Data<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">23</ref> ) and collective uses by a community of individuals (called Big Personal Data <ref type="bibr">24</ref> ).</p><p>The first part of the paper is thus dedicated to personal agency in the Personal Big Data context. We first review data portability and its current implementation through PIMS. Then, we underline the strongest form of empowerment to be currently suggested. Finally, we introduce a new "bilateral trust" condition, which should be met for the individual to interact with personal agency with third parties.</p><p>In the second part of the article, we investigate the case of empowerment in a collective context, where Big Data functionalities would be provided to a community of citizens. Firstly, we describe the collective uses of personal data in the field of AI and review the current dominant scenarios, in order to conclude that they disregard personal agency. Secondly, we review alternative suggestions to provide for personal agency. Finally, we introduce a second necessary condition of trust driven by personal agency -mutual trust-and outline a preliminary proposal for a legal and technical construction on this basis. The last section summarises our main findings and concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. Empowerment with personal agency for Personal Big Data</head><p>This part follows a two-phase development. In the first stage, we shall briefly review the history of data portability and its implementation using PIMS. Then, we identify two different levels of empowerment currently set out -weak and strong empowerment-, to examine the strongest form of empowerment as implemented by PIMS. In the second stage, we propose a new condition based on personal agency, to enable empowerment in the context of Personal Big Data. This new condition allows individuals to transmit calculated results (i.e., personal information resulting from a calculation) to third parties of their choice, rather than their detailed personal data. Indeed, the entropy of information of an aggregated result is much less informative than that of a complete personal data history. As a result, personal agency enhances the ability of individuals to further regulate the dissemination of their personal data. We illustrate this by an example and discuss two important questions to make it applicable, centred on architectural choices and the individual's liability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Asserting individual empowerment: an overview of the current context</head><p>Data portability, as a salient new right in the GDPR <ref type="bibr">25</ref> , opens new legal and technological opportunities. Emerging from joint projects such as Blue Button (medical data) and Green Button (electricity consumption data) in the United States, MiData (related to energy, financial, telecommunications and retail data) in Great Britain or MesInfos in France, piloted by FING (a non-profit French think tank) and supported by CNIL (the French personal data protection agency), this allows citizens to download all or some of their data in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">26</ref> digital format. <ref type="bibr">27</ref> Those projects might pave the way for empowering individuals at different scales. We propose to highlight existing PIMS in order to ascertain to what extent they empower individuals, and confront them to our vision of a developed empowerment based on personal agency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">A brief history of PIMS: technical and legal frameworks</head><p>Regarding the technical framework, one of the earliest systems allowing individuals to manage their personal data under their exclusive control was introduced in the United States in 2008 by Eben Moglen, Professor at Columbia University. Called "FreedomBox"<ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">28</ref> this system uses personal servers like plug-computer (a low-cost mini-PC such as RaspberryPI) and free software to help individuals elude State control and keep social exchanges private.</p><p>The concept of a personal data server then emerged in academia, with proposals from INRIA<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">29</ref> and MIT<ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">30</ref> , possibly benefiting individuals (cross-analysis of personal data hosted in different data silos, quantified self-tracking), third parties (sharing results of personal data computations) or society as a whole (collaboration between groups of individuals).</p><p>Commercial proposals appeared from 2012 onwards (Meeco, Cozy Cloud, etc.) and the terminology shifted towards the concept of "personal cloud". These solutions include online offerings ("cloud") and are exclusively aimed at individuals ("personal"), who are given a "digital home" ("Welcome to your new digital home"<ref type="foot" target="#foot_9">31</ref> is the Cozy Cloud motto) with advanced capacities for quantified self-analysis ("Meeco's manifesto reads: "[...] What if you and I had the same power?"). <ref type="bibr">32</ref> FING uses the term PIMS, or "personal information management systems", as a technical solution that integrates and applies big data processing to an individual's data for self-tracking purposes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">33</ref> FING has also introduced the concept of "self data", defined as the exploitation of personal data by individuals for their own purposes. <ref type="bibr">34</ref> Lastly, Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the web, published an open letter 35 in September 2018 criticising the current state of the web and the monopolies it engenders in personal data management. With his own roadmap including personal data management techniques, the Turing Award winner has in turn launched a personal data management solution. 36 Tim Berners-Lee invokes the principle of "personal empowerment through data" ("data should empower you") but also uses the concept of personal agency ("you will have far more personal agency over data"), <ref type="bibr">37</ref> which he believes is fundamental to the success of the next era of the web.</p><p>As a follow-up to these projects, reforms have been made in European and French law enshrining the right to personal data portability for data subjects, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">38</ref> with the intent to turn this new prerogative into an empowerment tool to adjust the balance of power between major service suppliers and their users <ref type="bibr">39</ref> . Individuals can retrieve their data free of charge in an open-access, machine-readable format and can thus move from one operator to another without losing their track record. They can also take control and manage their data and its use themselves <ref type="bibr">40</ref> . Portability consequently has become an instrument for "privacy by using"<ref type="foot" target="#foot_11">41</ref> , a tool to learn about privacy protection mechanisms, encouraging individuals to reclaim their informational autonomy<ref type="foot" target="#foot_12">42</ref> , as an essential part of digital literacy. In fact, this new right enables individuals to take back some control over their personal data, in two different ways: by both "receiv[ing] the personal data concerning him or her" 43 and having "the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another" 44 . Yet, the strict scope of application of this right counteracts the idea of empowered individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">45</ref> , fully able to control their personal data, even more in the Big Data era. This right is subject to various conditions narrowing its field of application <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">46</ref> . Indeed, it can only be exercised for data that (i) the individual "provided to a controller" <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">47</ref> on the basis of consent or contractual performance 48 and (ii) only if the processing is carried out by automated means. Therefore, portability appears considerably limited, concerning its legal scope <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">49</ref> and material scope <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">50</ref> .</p><p>As this right has not yet reached its full potential, academics and institutions call for an enhanced regulation, some through competition law <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">51</ref> , others through data protection law <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">52</ref> . For instance, the Commission underlines the "absence of technical tools and standards that make the exercise of their rights simple and not only burdensome" and aknowledges that true empowerment should not be limited to mere portability <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">53</ref> as "switching of service providers", but also aim at "enabling data reuse in digital ecosystems". <ref type="bibr">54</ref> The Commission therefore highlights the need to create a supportive environment for the development of these solutions, requiring a more progressive interpretation of the article 20 provisions. Recital 68 of the GDPR, which focuses on the sole transmission to another data processor 55 , might, according to the European Commission, require to enhance data portability to give individuals "more control over who can access and use machine-generated data" such as "realtime data access and making machine-readable formats compulsory". <ref type="bibr">56</ref> Consequently, the EU Commission expresses its willingness to possibly include this extension as part of the 2021 Data Act.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Current status: weak empowerment and strong empowerment</head><p>In its actual state, empowerment gained from exercising the right to portability seems to range from "weak empowerment", where individuals merely switch from one commercial service to another, to "strong empowerment", where individuals migrate to a personal data management service and thus regain sovereignty over their data. Legislators plainly conceived this prerogative as competition-focused 57 , in the manner of the phone number portability advocated to force telecommunications operators to open up the market by lowering the exit barriers <ref type="bibr">58</ref> . The right to data portability is therefore an instrument for extricating oneself from a captive ecosystem: it allows individuals to migrate from one operator to another without losing their data and without the drudgery of retrieving data from different systems. <ref type="bibr">59</ref> It imparts service users with more freedom of choice, and could stimulate competition through innovation. Empowerment limited to this choice can be referred to as "weak". Empowerment may be characterised as "strong" when data recovery gives individuals an active role in the data lifecycle. It was in this context that personal cloud solutions were developed as a corollary to these new portability rights. They form the technical lever to exercise the right to portability. An individual's personal cloud has a range of connectors (to their bank, their employer and any external service that possesses their personal data) which lets them retrieve their personal data automatically. <ref type="bibr">60</ref> With these offerings, they can combine all their data in a single system and adjust access in favour of innovative services.</p><p>Considering "strong empowerment" being the most advanced and promising version of data portability, we shall clarify its meaning in terms of features, in the context of PIMS. Recent reviews of personal cloud solutions, 56 COM(2020) 66 final, p. 20 <ref type="bibr">57</ref>   <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">62</ref> or in experimental form, <ref type="bibr">63</ref> unanimously agree on the intended purposes. The key point here is to re-establish the individuals' control over the lifecycle of their personal data 64 , from collection to destruction, while enhancing the use by individuals of their own data.</p><p>In terms of features <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">65</ref> , the first and foremost promise is to automatically reconstitute full personal records, which were originally stored in different data silos 66 (banking, medical history, internet search history, geolocation, social exchanges, etc.). The second key promise made to individuals is the cross-analysis of personal information, allowing them to benefit from the interconnection of personal records from different sources. For instance, a medical examination and its corresponding prescription can be automatically retrieved from bank records of the reimbursement for medication. As a third promise, cross-exploitation of individuals' data also allows them to derive statistical information and complex computed results from their records, in a quantified self-tracking perspective. For example, comparing medical data such as weight or cholesterol levels with physical activity or step counts allows them to monitor their health.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Personal agency as a determining condition of individual empowerment</head><p>While certain legal and technical conditions regarding data portability rights are met, such as personal cloud tools, the ability for individuals to perform Personal Big Data, thus achieving empowerment, raises a key question: what kind of personal agency do individuals hold to implement their decision? Ensuring that users have the capacity to act entails checking whether they are able to assume the new power granted to them, i.e. in this case, responsibility for making decisions relating to how their own data is managed (knowing who to share it with, hence making informed decisions), and the ability to orchestrate the implementation and effectiveness of their decisions (being able to contribute to implementation and to assume control over it). We shall introduce here a new trust condition that individuals must be able to establish to exercise their personal agency, that we call bilateral trust. It will be illustrated by Example 1, and open questions regarding the technical processing architecture and the legal liabilities of the individual in this context shall be discussed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Personal agency in the context of Personal Big Data: a new trust condition</head><p>Assuming management of one's own data in terms of Personal Big Data with personal agency would presuppose a capacity to (i) administer and secure one's data, (ii) stipulate and apprehend permissions to different applications and third parties, and (iii) define which processing is authorised and set up safeguards to ensure one's decisions are effective. We thus argue that transposing personal agency to the Personal Big Data context would lead individuals to secure bilateral trust whilst the personal data underlying their decisions is processed. On one hand, individuals must be assured that their data is handled in line with the decisions made and that the Personal Big Data computation will indeed be implemented faithfully and confidentially (i.e. the expected code is executed, and the personal data provided in inputs is not exposed). On the other hand, third parties and external applications need a reciprocal guarantee from the individual, that the Personal Big Data processing results are indeed using the right datasets and are run as expected. This means being able to settle a two-sided trust guarantee, which we call bilateral trust. In Example 1, we illustrate this condition in the simple case of computing an energy bill based on a customer's energy consumption traces.</p><p>Example 1: Personal Big Data to enable citizens to compute energy bills.</p><p>More and more citizens are concerned about feeding personal data to external services. When calculating an energy bill, the energy consumption traces generated by a smart metre, which reveal details of the individual's activity, are sent to the energy supplier who then calculates the bill and charges the customer.</p><p>Big Data for the citizen: an ability to interact with third parties without revealing personal data. The PIMS alternative ensures that "services move to the data" rather than personal data being sent to services. Citizens can thus exercise data portability to retrieve traces of consumption from their smart metre, and a computation code/app provided by their energy supplier is downloaded on their PIMS to produce the bill. The issue related to personal agency is that the energy supplier must trust the individual.</p><p>Bilateral trust as a necessary condition for "Personal agency". Personal agency aims to empower citizens to perform such Personal Big Data computations on their own. This requires making individuals capable of bilateral trust, by of two main new capabilities:</p><p>(1) First, the ability to guarantee to the individual that their raw personal data remains confidential. To the extent that detailed energy consumption trails may reveal the individual's activity, this is a prerequisite to trigger adoption.</p><p>(2) Second, the capacity for the individual to undertake that the final result was indeed computed on the expected dataset (the provider must be sure that the data subject has not truncated their data to lower the bill) and used the expected code (the one furnished by the energy provider). This is an essential issue if the client is to be charged according to the result. The provider may only have access to the aggregated energy consumption result (needed to charge the client), or be allowed to hold a finer degree of data (for instance, in case of billing error or dispute).</p><p>In light of this necessary bilateral trust, the technical and legal conditions in which the PIMS solutions are offered shall be analysed in order to determine which are likely to ensure personal agency. In other terms, attempting to assess the personal agency of service users implies ascertaining which party enjoys actual agency. From a technical perspective, one must assess who is trusting whom and thus who the administrator is, therefore questioning the processing architecture. From a legal standpoint, liability issues are raised, for example in the case of error or dispute. An additional concern is to make the proposal appropriate (and acceptable) in practice, while avoiding to overburden the individual. In the following, we discuss these open questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Conditions and framework for personal agency : a call for a new vision</head><p>From a technical perspective, one notable feature of the personal cloud is that the processing and applications of Personal Big Data "are moving" to the relevant data, as opposed to personal data which migrates toward remote services, as it occurs with most existing cloud services 67 . Individuals' personal agency can hence be measured by their capacity to implement this type of application under their exclusive control, in a digital ecosystem that allows them to build the desired reciprocal trust. Personal agency would therefore depend on architectural choices for personal clouds, i.e. the technical solutions implemented.</p><p>With centralised approaches (for example, MyDex.org or MyData.org), data administration and security is based on the personal cloud platform provider. This type of centralised management built on delegation technically allows secondary uses (beyond the individual's control) and exacerbates the risk of large-scale attacks (affecting millions of individuals). This requires strong trust 68 from individuals to the platform provider and all the personal applications running on the system. In this respect, the Data Governance Act proposes conditions to reinforce trust in the intermediaries ensuring data portability, to be used in the different data spaces. Self-hosting is a solution based on decentralised architecture, where each individual manages their own personal data on domestic hardware (for example, Di.Me, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">70</ref> CloudLocker, Cozy Cloud, Databox or Tim Berners-Lee's Solid). This gives individuals physical control over the platform which, if properly implemented, gives very high overall security (the cost-benefit ratio of an attack is dissuasive because any one attack only reveals a single individual's data). But responsibility for administering this system might befall individuals, with the attendant risk of error, loss or theft of personal data <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">71</ref> . The DynDNS attack in late 2016, which infected nonsecure embedded systems like printers and internet boxes, points out the vulnerability of solutions.</p><p>Intermediate architectural solutions to these two extreme approaches can pave the way for different compromises according to the level of personal agency sought.</p><p>From a legal view, several questions must be addressed. First, how can the individual's ability to make informed decisions relating to the use of their personal data be ensured? On this point, the legal framework needs clarification, particularly as regards the expression of consent by the agent (the first condition of personal agency). One must ensure that users have the technical and capacities to make informed choices (second condition of personal agency).</p><p>Second, are individuals with personal agency therefore called upon to bear all responsibility when it comes to processing their own data with these Personal Big Data solutions? This raises concerns about excessive responsibility, leading to a potential "boomerang effect". The regulators also stress that users must be informed of the risks they run in taking over management of their own data, in that they lose access to the data security solutions offered by data controllers and take responsibility for the data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">72</ref> This is all the more true as the liability regime established by the GDPR does not seem designed <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">73</ref> to take into account the shift in perspective caused by these new individual data management solutions. Some are bound to criticise a potential elusion of liability by operators offering these new individual data management services, who might claim that their individual users should be qualified as data controllers <ref type="bibr">74</ref> . Yet, the latter might benefit from the purely personal or household activity exemption, excluding the application of the GDPR <ref type="bibr">75</ref> . In this case, the GDPR applies to the provider of the means for such processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">76</ref> . The issue is that those means must be essential <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">77</ref> , and not only technical and organisational, to trigger the qualification of data controller 78 . In the case of personal data management systems, the provider might be qualified as data controller <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">79</ref> . However, as he merely supplies the means for individuals to "compute" their personal data, he cannot be liable for all the obligations under the GDPR 80 . This qualification must reflect the exact involvement of the provider so as not to exceed his personal responsibility 81 . Since users of technical means might be qualified as joint controllers alongside the provider, as set out by the European Court of Justice 82 , the issue is still pending for individual users of PIMS. Consequently, the entire liability chain between individuals, providers, suppliers and third-party services should be clarified in relation to the relevant architecture. <ref type="bibr">83</ref> Beyond the agent, the liability of third parties involved in this ecosystem should be thought over, whether they provide tools or control applications, once it is agreed that technical liability cannot be laid exclusively at the door of the individual, albeit one who has sovereign control over their own data. It must be shared between actors in varying degrees, according to the architectures and each party's level of intervention in the use of the data. These are the conditions to ensure that "strong empowerment" does not ultimately lead to the exclusion of all safeguards provided for by the GDPR to protect individuals in data processing.</p><p>More generally, we can notice that whether weak (ability to migrate from one service to another) or strong (ability to conduct third-party processing of one's own data with bilateral guarantees), empowerment as promoted heretofore is undeniably a prerequisite in building a new approach ensuring individuals a degree of personal agency over their own data. However, it should be noted that the current purposes of PIMS solutions, as propounded by their editors and considered by academics or associations, essentially entail strictly individual benefits <ref type="bibr">84</ref> . Moreover, the uses and technologies to create bilateral trust between individuals and a third party remain poorly implemented. Lastly, self-hosting solutions are limited to individuals who are sufficiently concerned about protecting their privacy to acquire the necessary expertise (to the point of playing sorcerer's apprentice) to install and administer their own system. Thus, Personal Big Data nowadays is aimed mainly at users interested in self-tracking and in cross-checking data for their sole benefit. These advantages remain insufficient to trigger widespread adoption. Some proposals have attempted to provide stronger incentives, although they are still based on individual interests. In many cases, these entail enabling individuals to "monetise" their personal data. For example, the start-up Embleema offers a personal cloud system based on blockchain, where individuals can collate their healthcare data from hospital and laboratory sites, from DMPs or connected objects (like Fitbit watches) to monetise access. <ref type="bibr">85</ref> Over the medium term, the aim is to set up a marketplace for healthcare data, giving stakeholders access to "real-time" data on patients in return for payment. This reopens the debate on whether individuals "own their data" which opposes proponents of liberal analysis 86 and defenders of the right to informational autonomy as the ultimate guarantee of individual freedom in the digital age. <ref type="bibr">87</ref> For data empowerment to genuinely take off, we need to broaden the ambitions. Indeed, the power derived by the individual from their personal data remains limited as long as the ability to establish bilateral trust is not provided. This is a necessary (unsatisfied) condition of agency as demonstrated by the first part of this paper. Moreover, full power over personal data requires the exploitation of the data of many individuals (and not just one), following the example of the personal data exploitation deployed by the major web players which is based on using personal data of millions of individuals.

The following part considers the conditions for collective agency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. Drafting collective empowerment based on personal agency</head><p>This part is organised in three sections. First, we will appraise the current schemes to access and process vast amounts of personal data (Big Personal Data), in order to conclude that these tend to disregard personal agency. In a second section, we shall analyse potential alternatives, whose aim is to facilitate the collective exercise of portability rights in a regulatory framework, with a nascent sense of personal agency. Finally, we argue that collective personal agency opens up to new uses of personal data, which could be defined by citizens themselves, but not only as suggested by pre-existing services or organizations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. A global race for collective uses: approaches devoid of personal agency</head><p>Cross-checking personal data among vast populations has both individual and social advantages in many areas such as healthcare, banking, smart cities, social assistance, etc. This collective use of personal data is based on computation methods referred to as Big Personal Data 89 , that involve Big Data processing on the personal data of thousands or even millions of individuals. The processes underlying Big Personal Data combine techniques ranging from simple statistical analysis (grouping, aggregation) through automatic information search (automatic classification, rule discovery) to learning (based for instance on neural networks). As noted by the task force "AI for Humanity" in France, led by CÃ©dric Villani, a combination of these techniques and their rapid growth have given rise to fierce competition in the global race for Artificial Intelligence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">90</ref> With data now seen as a "major competitive advantage", "data sharing between private stakeholders has been identified as one of the main levers to catching up with American and Chinese stakeholders, who have the advantage of having access to massive amounts of data". <ref type="bibr">91</ref> This explains the new ambition at the European level to access huge amounts of data "particularly from major stakeholders, who have a de facto monopoly on the collection of certain categories of data". <ref type="bibr">92</ref> However, compared to Personal Big Data (see the first part above), Big Personal Data introduces a new difficulty: that of gathering data from large sets of individuals and carrying out the required processing. What are the contemplated scenarios and what is the situation regarding the data subjects' personal agency? 1. Identified models: B to G, B to B and G to B Firstly, some advocate an "open model", which involves enshrining the wider concept of "data of general interest", a category of data established in France since the Law for a Digital Republic in 2016. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">93</ref> This type of model allows to move forward in opening up private sector data; concurrently, the European Commission has also envisaged arrangements to facilitate access to data held by private companies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">94</ref> From this perspective, the Villani task force recommended gradually opening up datasets from private operators "on a case-by-case basis" and according to the sector "for motives of general interest". <ref type="bibr">95</ref> This could take place in two different ways: <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">96</ref> the opening up of private data for general interest purposes in favour of public authorities (Business to Government, or "B to G") to help the development of public policies. For instance, mobility data inferred from flows of people or vehicles could be obtained from operators such as Orange, Waze and Uber and processed by the government, in particular to conduct research into reducing road traffic accidents; -data sharing in favour of other economic stakeholders (Business to Business, or "B to B") for economic purposes such as innovation, research, the development of new services or AI or to boost competition. The banking sector is cited as an example, where Directive PSDP2 requires banking institutions to provide access to their clients' data to encourage the development of innovative businesses ("Fintech"). However, data sharing should be subject to certain conditions: in addition to compliance to the GDPR, the principle of proportionality needs to be respected and the relevant companies' interests must not be adversely affectedwhich presupposes protecting business secrecy and the possibility to monetise dataand this in turn prohibits to subject such access to compulsory gratuity "for trade between companies for which there would normally be a charge". The principle of transparency must also be respected.</p><p>Another form of opening up consists in giving the economic sector access to data currently held and managed by state actors (Government to Business, or "G to B"). For instance, the "Health Data Hub" <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">97</ref> task force was set up in France to investigate the provision of healthcare datasets held by the State to economic stakeholders. The task force concluded that "healthcare data financed through social welfare is a communal heritage and recommended that "this data should be fully exploited for the benefit of the largest number of people" once they have been matched and documented with metadata to facilitate exploitation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">98</ref> Respect for privacy is based on personal data pseudonymity (where data is stripped of any directly identifying information). <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">99</ref> To ensure overall economic viability, the proposal also suggests that access to the "hub" could be "charged for private stakeholders in the form of a fixed subscription fee and a variable charge depending on usage". <ref type="bibr">100</ref> The European Commission's Data Governance Act also moves in this direction to promote the circulation of data in B-to-B and G-to-B models. 101</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Limitations: models devoid of personal agency</head><p>Fears could be raised about these three data sharing models (B to G, B to B, G to B 102 ). These differ mainly in terms of the public or private nature of the recipient entity, which is in charge of managing the vast amounts of collected personal data. However, most agree on a personal data management model operated beyond the data subjects' control. Some of these models are comparable to the current cloud solutions, criticised for the issues they raise in terms of security, privacy and informational asymmetry as regards the individuals involved. Thus, the sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks increases alongside the rising volume of data that could potentially be disclosed. There is a further risk of re-identification if the data anonymisation techniques are too weak to provide appropriate protection; this risk is proven as regards pseudonymity, which is no longer considered an adequate anonymisation technique. <ref type="bibr">103</ref> Moreover, the potential for secondary uses which are inconsistent with the initial purposes depends exclusively on the trust placed in the centralising entity and on all its providers. None of these approaches however contemplates obtaining the data subjects' consent. Access to Big Personal Data therefore seems focused on simply transposing the existing controversial method of managing personal data, to the detriment of any form of personal agency for individuals, even in the case of sensitive healthcare data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Alternatives ensuring a form of personal agency</head><p>Since the aforementioned scenarios are devoid of personal agency, we shall examine some promising alternative proposals under discussion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Collective portability as a condition of personal agency</head><p>Alternative proposals providing individuals with the means to collectively control the use of their personal data are being encouraged, in line with the development of "civic portability". The Villani task force has indeed suggested extending portability rights from an individual to a collective prerogative, particularly as regards AI. <ref type="bibr">104</ref> Thus, groups of citizens sharing common values and willing to act collectively (on the model of class actions), could exercise their portability rights and share their data with a public authority for a specific purpose, related to a public service mission. In the field of healthcare for instance, patients could make their medical data available to a research institute to improve the detection or treatment of a pathology. The objective here would be to enable the creation of new databases in favour of public services by allowing the free movement of data "under the exclusive control of citizens". <ref type="bibr">105</ref> There again, portability could act as the cornerstone of this initiative, giving each individual the capacity to consent to processing and even to secure collective processing, thereby upholding another form of agency. This invites reflection on possible collective portability and empowerment. Meanwhile, some authors focus on the definition of group privacy and data protection 106 , notably by the expansion of data groups 107 . These emerging theories highlight the need for data protection law to broaden its scope of application, taking into account its collective aspect 108 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Employment law, data trusts and data altruism as first steps to ensure personal agency</head><p>Insofar as combining individual portability initiatives is insufficient to enable individuals to jointly orchestrate the uses resulting from the collection of their personal data, it seems that portability on its own cannot guarantee collective agency. One must therefore analyse how data subjects may be empowered to conduct collective processing under their control.</p><p>A first solution would be to incorporate collective "civic" portability within the existing legal framework. Thus, since the relevant personal data may result from an individual's labour (for example, data from Uber drivers), one could foresee overlapping analogies between employment law and data protection law. This gives rise to new ideas: 109 terms of use negotiated along the lines of collective agreements, a collective portability exercised within associations or trade unions 110 . Another solution could induce reconsidering the personal data governance model, given that "consent-based models of data governance fail to protect the public against privacy violations and the unethical collection and use of personal data". 111 Some authors have explored the implementation of new governance based on data trusts, and investigated other ways of regulating data usage. Such work however reached mixed conclusions, in that such control on data processing is ultimately based on the trust individuals place in their fiduciaries. <ref type="bibr">112</ref> The EU Data Governance Act promotes, on the one hand, services of data cooperatives<ref type="foot" target="#foot_16">113</ref> , and on the other hands, a new status for data voluntarily made available by individuals for the common good to non-profit organizations with the emergence of new "data altruism organizations" subject to a EU controlled registration process and a common European consent form. <ref type="bibr">114</ref> These studies reinforce the argument that the individuals' personal agency in data processing is closely linked to the ensuing empowerment prospects.</p><p>Although this is a step in the right direction, for example regarding the respect of indiviudals' consent, there is still one step missing: citizens organized into groups should be able to define and compute themselves results of interest for the community, without revealing their personal data, and with a proof that the results was indeed computed faithfully (and therefore could be used to enforce the rights of individuals).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Towards strong empowerment safeguarding personal agency for Big Personal Data</head><p>This section addresses the ways in which a group of individuals may be enabled to implement and control all the effects of a Big Personal Data processing, and which legal and technical framework is to be promoted. We shall analyse two (extreme) scenarios and their perspectives on personal agency. We will then introduce a new notion of mutual trust as a component of personal agency in the context of Big Personal Data, as illustrated by an example. We shall then discuss the underlying issues, in order to establish a new technical and legal framework for personal agency in this context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">The issue of personal agency in collective computations</head><p>Big Personal Data processing by a large set of individuals can be led according to various technical scenarios, with different perspectives in terms of personal agency. There are two different methods: on one hand, the centralised approach, which consists in bringing all the data to one entity for processing; on the other hand, the decentralised approach, where each contributing individual is treated as an autonomous entity, capable of interacting with all the others to operate the processing together. Although many technical solutions exist halfway between these two extremes, analysis of the latter allows to identify different prospects regarding personal agency.</p><p>The first approach requires a centralised controller, governed by a third party entity, to administer the digital environment in which the computations are to be performed. The effect on the appropriate security measures is colossal since the benefits of an attack on this centralised entity are very high (access to the personal data of millions of individuals). In addition, the trustworthiness of the central entity is key to avoid secondary use of the data. Personal agency thus resides solely in the trust individuals consent to place in a third party entity.</p><p>The second approach does not introduce a centralised control point. Instead, each individual can be seen as a computation node that bears responsibility for part of the processing. Accordingly, their control of each node gives individuals a role as an agent of the computation agent. This approach however poses distinct risks to individuals. Firstly, by its very nature, computation implies an exchange of personal data between participants, thus transforming each of them into a potential attacker. Secondly, the external infrastructure supporting the data exchanges (for example, internet gateways) can observe some of these exchanges. Lastly, the data processed at each node and data exchanges between nodes can neither be defined nor even understood or administered by a non-expert individual (without a specific framework). Thus, this approach offers a new perspective on personal agency, but also presupposes the definition of a legal and technical framework that allows individuals to exercise their rights freely.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Personal agency for Big Personal Data: mutual trust</head><p>Elevating individuals to agents in terms of Big Personal Data consists in enabling them to decide (for example through consenting) whether to contribute to such a processing with their own personal data. It also means providing assurances to all data subjects involved that the processing is conducted in line with the stated purpose, with integrity and confidentiality. While personal agency relating to Personal Big Data establishes bilateral trust between an individual and a third party, each individual agent in Big Personal Data processings must be able to establish mutual trust between all participating individuals and the third party entity to which the results are sent. On one hand, each individual must have a guarantee that their own data cannot be disclosed during processing and that all the other participants will act in a trustworthy manner and implement the processing as expected, in accordance with what each has been consented to. If one of the agents noticed a failure or violation, no result should ever be produced. Conversely, the recipient of the final result must be assured that it complies with the expected processing, based on the right dataset from the stated number of participants. We illustrate this mutual trust condition through Example 2, which stages a collective of parents computing statistics based on the online gaming data of their children.</p><p>Example 2: Big Personal Data to help parents reduce their children's addiction to video games. More and more parents are worried about their children's addiction to online video games, such as freeto-play cooperative multiplayer "Battle Royale" games. These concerns are justified when video games companies have at their disposal petabytes of data used to feed Big Data algorithms to make the games as addictive as possible. Indeed, the main source of income for this category of games (free-to-play) are ingame purchases and events, which explains the publishers' willingness to maximise the timethat millions of users spend playing. Confronted to this issue, parents may feel powerless. They can either prevent their children from playing games at the risk of isolating them, or do nothing and let them sink into addiction.</p><p>Big Data for the citizen: an ability to explore 'anti-toxic' conditions. A reasonable solution would be to analyse the playing habits of children populations, to help determine the attitude parents could adopt when their child seems to develop an addiction. Thus, just as games editors use Big Data to quantify the impact of new game features on increasing children's playtime, parents should be empowered with Big Data means to collectively help defining better conditions to prevent children from being addicted. Mutual trust as a necessary condition for "Personal agency". The notion of personal agency introduced in this article aims to empower willing parents to jointly define and perform Big Data computations for their collective benefit. Making parents "agents" of such collective computations requires providing them with mutual trust, by means of three new capabilities:</p><p>(1) First, the ability to ensure that the children's personal data will remain confidential. This is a prerequisite to convince parents to supply children's data in the computation and trigger broad adoption.</p><p>(2) Second, the capacity to attest that the final result was indeed computed on the expected data, with the agreed code and the appropriate number of participants. This is a necessary condition if the result is to serve as a basis for future decisions and recommendations in order to enforce the rights of the children.</p><p>(3) Third, the capability to ensure compliance with the legal basis for processing, the legitimate obtention of the relevant personal data through the exercise of the data portability right, informed consent, with clear statements concerning purpose, minimal personal data collection and no further use of personal data.</p><p>The Manifesto-based framework<ref type="foot" target="#foot_18">115</ref> : a new legal-technical solution operated in three phases.</p><p>Step 1: Formulate a hypothesis to be checked. Consider a collective (or association) of parents of young players aiming to reduce their children's playtime. For example, one could allow children to play more frequently but for a shorter time, limit the amount of games instead of the playtime, provide a fixed amount of money to be spent in the game (rather than let the children "win" it in the game), organise collective sessions (e.g., with remote classmates) rather than playing alone, block videos related to these games with parental control on Youtube, etc. Would some strategies overcome others in terms of reducing playtime in the long run?</p><p>Step 2: Express a Manifesto for the collective computation. To test some of these options, the parents may express a Manifesto, which is both a set of rules describing the computation and a formulation of the legal basis for the considered processing. The manifesto can act as a contract, drafted between all the participants, giving their consent to the collection and processing of personal data, and to the random attribution of an 'agent' role in the computation, such as data collector or data aggregator. The obligations can be deferred until the realisation of a future condition (e.g., reaching the required threshold for the processing to start). This manifesto must be validated by a regulatory body (e.g. CNIL in France) which certifies its compliance with privacy laws. This certified manifesto is then published so that parents who wish to participate can download it and give their consent.</p><p>Step 3: Execution of the Manifesto. This phase starts when the number of consenting parents reaches the threshold specified in the manifesto. Any participating parent is endowed with the aforementioned three capacities. From a technical standpoint, the condition to enforce these abilities in recent proposals 116 is that the participating parents' personal computer is equipped with a processor implementing 'trusted execution environments' in hardware (which is the case for recent computers endowed with Intel or AMD processors).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Rethinking a legal and technical framework to secure collective agency</head><p>To achieve a generalisation of Big Personal Data, a framework needs to be defined, firstly to support the essential elements of personal agency and secondly to avert the risks of privacy breach as well as damage to the integrity of the computation.</p><p>Among the relevant issues, the first one is whether the regulation forbids individuals to collectively use the personal data they have recovered pursuant to the exercise of their portability right. If the GDPR allows such Big Personal Data processing 117 , the second issue is on its relevant legal basis. In our view, the choice of consent as a legal basis for inter-individual processing is the best option, insofar as consent is the only legal basis empowering and providing agency to individual. The conditions for consent to be lawful in this context supports this point: the data subject must be "offered control and (be) offered a genuine choice with regard to accepting or declining the terms offered or declining them without detriment" 118 . Consent is the only legal basis allowing individuals to have a granular control over which data is being processed; it may also be retracted at any point, along with the data processed under such legal basis. The regulation requires consent 119 to be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous, by a clear affirmative act 120 .</p><p>It could be expressed for example by means of a manifesto stipulating the type of Big Personal Data processing to be performed, where the purpose, the collected data, the computation code distributed to the participants, the result produced and the recipient entity are laid out, as well as the minimum number of participants required to achieve a useful result. Next, the manifesto would need to be verified and validated by a regulatory authority (such as the CNIL, the French data protection authority, or ANSSI, the French national cybersecurity agency). In addition to validating each case, the issue for the regulator is whether to draw up data collection clauses clarifying the types of algorithms implemented and the permissible output. Once approved, the manifesto would be published and made available to adequate groups of people, who could then decide whether or not to sign up. The regulator's endorsement would provide various guarantees ensuring respect for their personal data, securing their personal agency and, in time, could give rise to the drafting of a sectoral code of conduct to delineate the responsibilities and undertakings of stakeholders in Big Personal Data. Finally, a secure mechanism to ensure the agency of participants should be able to allocate the processing across all participants and execute it, without deviating from the manifesto or revealing any data other than the final result, thus safeguarding the mutual trust outlined above. This could be considered as a realistic objective in the current state of technology. The conventional computation techniques used in business systems cannot be applied here due to the unusual scale of distribution (the computation could in theory encompass a fraction of the population of a country). Some secure distributed computation protocols based on cryptographic techniques (called "secure multiparty computation") could be used in some cases but cannot yet perform satisfactorily if extended to support generic computations for a large number of participants.</p><p>However, new technologies are currently being developed and use trusted computing hardwarewhich one is usually already equipped withto set up generic secure distributed processing on a large scale. Most smartphones and PCs belonging to individuals now have secure processors such as Intel SGX, ARM Trustzone, AMD PSP, etc. A recent study<ref type="foot" target="#foot_19">121</ref> shows that the concept of mutual trust as defined above is compatible with these types of hardware.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we have showed that the notion of personal agency, as set out by social sciences, can be transposed to the case of personal data processing in the Big Data context. We provided a general definition of personal agency, which offers a new angle to analyse the proposed approaches for personal data processing operations.</p><p>A first interpretation of this definition in the context of Personal Big Data allows individuals to transmit calculated results (i.e., personal information resulting from a calculation) to third parties of their choice, rather than their detailed personal data. Indeed, the entropy of information of an aggregated result (e.g., the total amount of electricity consumed in the last month) is much less informative than that of a complete personal data history (e.g., consumption values produced on a power line reveal the electrical appliances used at each moment <ref type="bibr">122</ref> and can therefore be used to infer precise daily behavior of household residents). As a result, personal agency enhances the ability of individuals to further regulate the dissemination of their personal data.</p><p>As a second interpretation, we have shown that personal agency opens up to new collective uses of personal data, where citizens organized into groups, are able to confidentially and compliantely calculate and deduce information from the group's personal data, with the possibility of proving that the result was obtained on given sets of personal data of the participants, using appropriate code, faithfully executed.</p><p>In both situations, this leads to the formulation of new necessary conditions related to the degree of trust that individuals must be able to provide to each other to be considered as "agents" of the processing. In the case of "Personal Big Data", a bilateral trust condition must be established. In the case of "Big personal data", a condition of mutual trust is required. We therefore outlined a preliminary proposal for a legal-technical coconstruction illustrated by examples, which reflect the feasibility of these conditions in the current state of technology, and discuss related challenges which remain to be addressed.</p><p>Of course, many details will still need to be ironed out. Some technical building blocks demonstrating the feasibility of such a solution remain to be established. Many other open-ended questions may be raised: should user consent be set up for each processing operation or for a group of processing operations? How can it be formally demonstrated that one can withstand a small number of users who tamper with their hardware to attack security featuresthough the hardware security technologies are difficult to attack, vulnerabilities can always arise in an environment where security amounts to a race between hackers and manufacturers? How should the mechanisms described be integrated in a real operating system, and more particularly within existing PIMS products? Combining the circulation of huge amounts of data with informational sovereignty for each individual means that they should be seen as agents of the ecosystem currently being set up. A new structure therefore needs to be built to ensure full personal agency, with underlying mutual guarantees for individuals and for the entire ecosystem in which they operate. The terms still need to be adjusted but this new way must be explored to avoid individuals to be seen as mere datafied objects in the future. <ref type="bibr">123</ref> </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>For an overview of mobile number portability and its effects on competition, see: B.
