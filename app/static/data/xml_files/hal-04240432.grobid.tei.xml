<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Overview. In this demonstration, we propose a tool to assist users with the problem of the minimization of personal data collected in the context of administrative forms. Data minimization is a fundamental privacy concept defined in many privacy regulations (such as the European General Data Protection Regulation or GDPR <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>) that states that only the data necessary to take a decision must be collected and stored. Data minimization has yet to see any kind of large scale (non trivial) implementation. We have recently proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> a model, based on propositional logic and game theory, to capture the general problem of data minimization. We propose to demonstrate the applicability of this approach on real forms.</p><p>General Context. Forms are filled by individuals who wish to apply for welfare benefits (e.g. in France). The volume of personal data thus collected is massive and concerns millions of individuals. For example, hundreds of different types of aids are offered in France at local or national level, to meet different social needs or provide incentives, with a very large number of beneficiaries. This includes aid for family, education, savings, access to housing, health, transport, mobility, energy saving, legal aid, etc. Governmental portals offer simulators so that citizens can identify the aids they can apply for. For example, aide-sociale.fr offers a rather holistic simulator (more than 1000 aids); the governmental portal mesdroitssociaux.gouv.fr is targeted on the most solicited aids (58 welfare aids) and also offers a simulator for young adults (887 aids). In order to be obtained, each proposed aid requires the beneficiary to fill out a form to collect their personal data showing that they meet the eligibility criteria and calibrating the aid. The allocation decision is made based on the collected data, which leads to the processing of millions of forms per year, with several weeks of instruction by the administration. For example, the public data set provided by the French government indicates that 6 million forms per year were processed on average over the period 2016-2020 for only 10 family welfare benefits. As another example, the social aid benefit related to "complementary health coverage" (which is one of those we propose to demonstrate) concerns 7.19 million beneficiaries in 2022 (see annual report of the complementary health insurance on p.10), all of whom had to send in their corresponding form to activate and subsequently renew the aid each year (see same report at bottom of p.8).</p><p>Objective. Given these staggering numbers, an effective solution to minimize data collected via forms, while properly informing the individual and obtaining their informed consent to the collection process, may lead to significant resource gains and more rigorous compliance with legal principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. We will show in this demonstration a PET (Privacy Enhancing Technology) which analyzes a given user's data, proposes all possible data minimizations, and quantifies the information that will subsequently be sent by the user, in order to let them make an informed decision on which minimization to choose.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">DATA MINIMIZATION RELATED WORK</head><p>Data minimization prior to processing has long been considered an unsolvable problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, with an overly negative influence on the quality of the processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, sometimes in contradiction with other legal obligations such as discrimination prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, fairness <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> or fraud detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Implementation is deemed too complicated for developers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, which has led to an overall limited adoption and compliance with this principle. Some barriers were removed by the introduction of a formalism clarifying the general objectives of a data minimizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Indeed, recent contributions show that such a formalism can be applied in the context of using machine learning to predict recommendations/personalization through performance metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, while minimizing the data taken as input and still producing a useful model as output, even though its quality is slightly reduced. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, we study the case of administrative forms, where such a trade-off between data minimization (or privacy) and performance (utility of the processing) does not apply. Indeed the full range of benefits due to individuals must be offered by virtue of law: any metric that reduces the legitimate benefits due to a user in exchange for better data minimization would not be acceptable. Moreover, using logic and game theory, we show how to bring meaningful information to the individual in order to obtain their informed consent on the collection process, which is also required by regulations. This demonstration is based on this last result. We explain our approach on an example in the following section, which will be used in the demonstration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">A DATA MINIMIZATION EXAMPLE</head><p>The RSA benefit. In this section, we walk the reader through our approach, using the "active solidarity income" (in French: "revenu de solidarité active", abbreviated as RSA) welfare benefit form. The volume of RSA requests is around 2 million forms processed per year 1 for a total spending of around 12 billion euros, which is the highest welfare benefit (in term of euros spent) in France. Note that our demonstration will feature the RSA, but also the complementary health coverage aids which is the welfare benefit with the most forms processed annually in France (over 7 million forms) for a total spending of around 2.8 billion euros, as detailed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. We believe these examples show that our approach can be used to manage real large scale use cases, and that there is a real impact on 1) the minimization of data sent and 2) the quantification of the data sent, thus improving the users information with a view to consent.</p><p>General approach. We consider an automatic decision making system, which processes user data, collected as a form of attribute/value pairs (e.g. 𝑎𝑔𝑒 = 25 or 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑔𝑛𝑎𝑛𝑡 = 𝑓 𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑒). We assume that the automatic decision making system uses logical rules, which we write in disjunctive normal form (DNF) (e.g. a disjunction of conjunctions, each conjunction representing one possibility of obtaining a benefit). This is the case of many classical AI approaches such as decision trees, which benefit from explainability. By considering the values of all a given user's attributes, we deduce the predicates triggered by the user.</p><p>Building the RSA form. The RSA example was built using data from its official description 2 . 17 predicates are used, which are a direct translation of the official texts, negations included : 1 See the Court of Auditors website, and for more details its recent report: "The Active Solidarity Income", Evaluation of a public policy, Jan. 2022 (link to the report). 2 See here for the official description (in French).  Eligibility criteria and benefits for RSA are outlined on the French "Family Allowance Fund". We directly translated the rules to a propositional formula, and then converted the formula to DNF using the Logical Expression Converter program (Haskell code available here). We then use a parser to transform this expression, and combine it with 𝑅 𝐴𝐷𝐷 to produce the DNF format used by our application (which is a DNF version of the DIMACS CNF format 3 ). The RSA.dnf file is available here. It is composed of the 17 predicates and a disjunction of 31 conjunctions of up to 12 different predicates. An example rule to obtain the benefit (e.g. the first of the 31 conjunctions) states that one needs to be French (𝑝 1 ), be over 25 years old (𝑝 5 ), live in France (𝑝 10 ), be a single parent (𝑝 11 ), and be neither conducting an internship (𝑝 14 ), a sabbatical (𝑝 16 ) or non-active (𝑝 17 ). The final rule is obtained by adding the predicates triggered in 𝑅 𝐴𝐷𝐷 , thus the final rule is : 𝑝 1 ∧𝑝 2 ∧¬𝑝 4 ∧𝑝 5 ∧¬𝑝 8 ∧𝑝 10 ∧𝑝 11 ∧𝑝 14 ∧𝑝 16 ∧𝑝 17 .</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝑝 1 : nationality = FRENCH</formula><p>Computing the Minimal Accurate Subvaluations. We precompute (offline) the Minimal Accurate Subvaluations (MAS) for all possible forms that can obtain the benefit. MAS are a subset of the 17 predicates that correspond to enough information to grant the benefit to a user, even if the user had multiple ways of obtaining the benefit. These subvaluations are minimal in the sense that no predicate can be removed while still granting the benefit to the user. In this example, there are 1296 cases to consider, and 24 MAS. One example of a MAS would be noted 𝑚 1 = _1001__0_11___111 where a 0 or 1 in a given position means the predicate must be revealed, along with its value true (1) or false (0) and _ (blank) means the predicate is not sent.</p><p>Linking MAS to forms. We next build a bipartite graph linking each MAS to all the forms that it is a subvaluation of. It is possible that a MAS is linked to several forms, and it is possible that a form is linked to several MAS. If a form is only linked to one MAS, then Choosing the MAS using game theory. In order to choose which MAS to send, we need to define a cost function, for instance the number of forms sending the MAS. We note this payoff function 𝑃𝑂 𝑆𝑀 (𝑚) (Same MAS) where 𝑚 is a MAS. We use game theory to compute the correct value of 𝑃𝑂 𝑆𝑀 . The game is to decide which MAS each player (a form) will send to the administration, and the objective of the game is to send the MAS with the highest 𝑃𝑂 𝑆𝑀 value. This is a one round game, all players announcing simultaneously their move. We show in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, Theorem 4.6 that this game admits a Nash equilibrium (thus the moves of rational players can be accurately predicted and computed), under a hypothesis on lexicographical ordering of the MAS : all players with only one choice play this choice, all players with equivalent choices will play the first MAS in lexicographical order. Note that each player reduces the value of 𝑃𝑂 𝑆𝑀 (𝑚) for all the 𝑚 that the player could have played, but in fact did not.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Informed Data Minimization</head><p>Example. Consider a user with the form (as in the demo video) : 𝑓 = 1100110111000111 (a 0 or 1 in a position means a false or true value for the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ predicate, bear in mind some are negative such as 𝑝 15 = 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒, which means the person is not on leave). This user has the choice between 2 different MAS : 𝑚 1 = _1001__0_11___111 which corresponds to 32 other different forms or 𝑚 2 = _100_1___11___111 which corresponds to 128 other different forms. Note that the number of different forms is less or equal to 2 𝑏 where 𝑏 is the number of blank predicates. Our informed consent minimizer thus informs the user of this possible choice, and lets the user decide, suggesting the better choice of 𝑚 2</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">DEMONSTRATION OUTLINE</head><p>Our demonstration is divided into 3 parts. The overall architecture is presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>.</p><p>(1) Presentation/creation of the decision process. We have already analyzed 2 French administrative welfare benefit procedures (RSA and Welfare benefits). It is also possible for participants to create their own decision process rules. (2) Processing of the decision process rules (PET service for data collection). This demonstrates the feasibility of our approach on real world examples. Processing of the examples takes up to a few minutes on a regular laptop. This process constructs the MAS then generates the bipartite graph (Algo. 1) and computes the payoff function using game theory (Algo. 2). (3) Informed consent for users (Data collection service/GUI).</p><p>Participants are invited to fill in a form. The form is then processed using the output of the previous service. Users are suggested minimized forms, and are informed of the corresponding payoff functions (i.e. number of other players who share the same "blanked" form).</p></div>
