<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>a b s t r a c t</head><p>The relational database SOWELL was created to better understand the behaviour and individual responses of gestating sows facing different short-term events induced: a competitive situation for feed, hot and cold thermal conditions, a sound event, an enrichment (straw, ropes and bags available) and an impoverishment (no straw, no objects) of the pen. The data were collected on 102 crossbred sows equipped with activity sensors, group-housed in video-recorded pens (16-18 sows per pen), with access to automatons. Feeding and drinking behaviours were extracted from the electronic feeders and drinkers' recordings. Social behaviours, physical activities and locations in the pen were recorded thanks to manual video analysis labelling at the individual scale. Accelerometer fixed on the sows' ears also recorded individual physical activities. The physical activity was also determined at a group scale by automatic video analysis using deep learning techniques. BWs, back fat thickness, and body condition (cleanliness, body damages) were recorded weekly during the whole gestation. Last gestation room data regarding environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, noise level) were recorded using automatic sensors. The database can fulfil different research purposes, namely sows' nutrition for example to better calculate the energy requirements regarding environmental factors, or also on welfare or health during gestation by providing indicators.</p><p>Ó 2023 The Author(s).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Value of the data</head><p>This data set presents a huge diversity of data collected on gestating sows at an individual scale: feeding and drinking behaviours, social behaviours, physical activities, reproductive performances, health and welfare status, and environmental conditions.</p><p>High number of individual data, mostly time series, can be used by researchers for machine learning approaches or data mining tasks requiring large datasets. Different short-term events can be useful for scientists to better understand sow's behaviour and individual variability of response to these different types of events. Finally, access to the database is made public to contribute to future research in gestating sows' behaviour, health, nutrition or welfare fields.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data description</head><p>The dataset is composed of 18 tables structured as a relational database, using SQL standard (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>). These tables are organised into three groups (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>):</p><p>-The tables named Farm, Sow, Pen, Group, Exp_sow, Event are linked to the sow's and experiment characteristics (in red, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) -The tables named Water_measure, Feed_measure, Sensor, Sound_measure, Air_temperature_measure, Activity_measure con-tain data collected by automatons or sensors at different time scales (in green, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) -The tables named Farrowing, Health_sow, Performances_sow, Sow_temperature, Activity_video_measure, Video_analysis contain other collected data (in blue, Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p><p>More precisely, Farm, Sow, Pen, Group, Exp_sow, Event and Sensor tables gather all information regarding, respectively: farms (country, number of sows per band and number of sow per feeder), sows (birth date and farm), gestation rooms (farm), groups (beginning and end date, gestation room), sows during an experiment (sow, artificial insemination date and boar identification dose, body condition at insemination, parity), events (date and kind), and sensors or automatons used (type, room of gestation).</p><p>Water_measure and Feed_measure tables describe all visits to the automatons (sow number, automatons used, date and hour of the beginning of the visit and its duration, and the amount eaten or drank). Sound_measure, Air_temperature_measure and Activity_measure tables gather the recordings of, respectively, the sound level meter (every seconds), the thermometer at group scale (every 5 minutes) and the accelerometers (every 30 minutes) at individual scale (date and hour of the measure, values measured). Farrowing table contains the number of piglets and the litter's weight at birth and weaning. Health_sow and Performances_sow tables gather the weekly recording of health problems, and BW and back fat thickness. The rectal and body temperatures are saved in Sow_temperature table including the sow's posture at measurement. Activity_video table gathers the data provided by automatic video analysis at group level (every 30 minutes).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental design, materials and methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Experimental protocol</head><p>The experiment took place at Pig Physiology and Phenotyping Experimental Facility (UE3P, INRAE, Rennes, France, https://doi. org/10.15454/1.5573932732039927E12). It included 102 crossbred sows (Landrace Â Large White), divided into five groups (approximately 20 sows), monitored throughout their gestation. The sows were group-housed (a few days after their artificial insemination) in a pen with a concrete floor enriched with straw (replaced daily), and the provision of two ''playing" chains. After 30 days, the sows not successfully inseminated (identified by echography) were moved out of the pen and of the experiment. The pen dimensions were 7.5 by 8.2 m, for a space allowance of 3.1 m 2 /sow for an initial group of 20 sows. Each sow was equipped with two radio frequency identification tags: one for the two self-locking electronic feeders (Gestal, JYGA Technologies Inc, Québec, Canada), and the other for the two electronic drinkers (Asserva, France). The feed was a blend of two diets (Low and High nutrient content), mixed and delivered daily by the feeder to each individual sow. A gestating sows' nutritional InraPorc model revised by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Gaillard et al. (2019)</ref> was used to estimate the daily nutrient requirements of each sow. Based on this information, the quantity of feed to supply and the daily proportions of the two diets to blend were calculated for each sow. With this feeding strategy, the quantity of feed to supply was individualised but fixed for each sow during all their gestation, except for a bump feeding of 500 g/d starting at 86 days. Two ceiling-mounted cameras (RS-CCPOE280IR4-DH, Ro-main Inc., Québec, Canada) provided a continuous day and night recording.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Data acquisition and pretreatment</head><p>Feeding and drinking behaviours were automatically recorded using automatons (electronic feeders and drinkers). Ambient tem- 2 Foreign keys are used to link data between tables of the database. perature and humidity were recorded thanks to sensors fixed in the gestation room at 1.8 m high from the ground (Lascar Electronics, United Kingdom, precision ± 0.45 °C), and the noise level by a sensor near one of the drinkers (Velleman Group, Belgium). Manual video analysis was carried out by trained observers to monitor individual social behaviour, localisation, occupation, and physical activity on defined short periods of 5-36 h. Sows were also equipped with an ear tag accelerometer (RF-Track, Rennes, France) continuously recording their physical activities. Physical activities were also automatically analysed at a group scale from video recordings by a convolutional neural network algorithm (Dilepix, Rennes, France; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Durand et al., 2022)</ref>. Data extracted from automatons and sensors were preprocessed to filter the outliers and aggregated daily sensors' files to feed a relational database. Row data from the accelerometers were not included in the database when the cumulated duration per hour was not equal to 60 minutes, and in case of duplicated rows. All the identification codes of automatons or sensors were linked to the experiment number of each sow. Every Monday morning during the gestation, sows were led to a nearby room in order to measure their BW (Schippers, The Netherlands, precision ± 0.5 kg), and their back fat thickness using an ultrasound portable device (Imago, ECM, France). Body conditions, including skin lesions and potential health problems, were also simultaneously recorded based on the Welfare Quality Ò Assessment <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Dalmau et al., 2009)</ref>. At the end of the gestation (i.e. one week before parturition), sows were transferred to the farrowing room, after recording their BW and their back fat thickness. During the first 6 hours after farrowing, the BW of the sow and its piglets were registered, as well as the number of piglets alive or stillbirth. The number of artificial inseminations, the date, and the boar identification dose were also recorded.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Induced short-term events</head><p>In addition to the setting up of the hierarchy at the constitution of the group, different perturbations events were induced during the experiment: a competitive feeding situation, cold and hot thermal variations, a sound event, and last, an enrichment and an impoverishment of the pen (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). A competitive feeding situation was created by closing one of the two available feeders for five consecutive days and nights. This was performed twice during gestation. The cold thermal condition was induced for three days and nights by increasing the ventilation frequency, opening the windows, and setting the thermostatic control at 12 ± 2 °C. Similarly, a hot thermal condition was induced thanks to two heaters, decreased of ventilation frequency and setting the thermostatic control at 32 ± 2 °C. The noise event was composed of random emission of 40 short sounds (alarms, animals, metallic and human voices) of 30 seconds, every 10 minutes for four consecutive hours twice a day (during the afternoon resting period, and during the night feeding period). The enrichment consisted of an extra straw supply in the pen in the first repetition and in the second by the provision of jute bags, a brush, and ropes inside the pen. During the impoverishment event, there was no straw or games in the pen. Each ''event week" followed a ''control week" (without any unusual perturbation event induced). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
