<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The Semantic Web <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> (SW) has undergone a steady and continuous development toward its primary objective, which is to associate meaning with the data and to exploit the data through intelligent processing techniques. We refer to assertional and intensional definitions provided by ontologies as an ontological knowledge base. Currently, we can use data mining techniques to exploit and extract hidden knowledge patterns from ontological knowledge bases (KBs), even in incomplete and noisy ontologies. These knowledge patterns are used to enrich an ontology at both terminological (TBox) and assertional (ABox) level. Level-wise generate-and-test methods related to these data mining techniques were proposed in the inductive logic programming (ILP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and a recent approach that exploits the resoning capabilities of the SW, like <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. In addition, EDMAR <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, an evolutionary inductive programming approach, was recently proposed to discover hidden knowledge patterns in the form of multi-relational association rules (ARs) coded in SWRL <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we construct a method to change metrics for scoring ARs into metrics for evaluating SWRL rules, with the aim to increase the number of metrics to assess the SWRL ©2019 IEEE. This is the authors' version of the work. It is posted here for your personal use. Not for redistribution. The definitive Version of Record was published in the Proceedings of RIVF 2019.</p><p>rules. New metrics will be used as fitness function in EDMAR and applied to three publicly available ontological KBs.</p><p>Basics and definitions are provided in Section II and III. Section IV describes how to convert metrics and defines some typical metrics. The EDMAR algorithm is shown in Section V. Section VI reports on experiments to find out the best metric. Section VII concludes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. BASICS</head><p>We refer to ontological KBs in Description Logics (DLs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, which are a family of formal knowledge representation languages and are the theoretical foundation of OWL <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>(the standard representation language in the Semantic Web). A DL KB K = T , A consisting of a TBox T containing the terminological axioms and an ABox A containing the assertional axioms. It should be recalled that DLs adopt the open-world assumption (OWA -a statement may be true irrespective of whether or not it is known to be true). For more details concerning DLs see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In the following, we address the general definition of relational AR with respect to a given ontological KB.</p><p>Definition 1 (Relational Association Rule). Given a populated ontological KB K = (T , A), a relational association rule r for K is a Horn-like clause of the form: body → head, where (a) body is a generalization of a set of assertions in K cooccurring together; (b) head is a consequent that is induced from K and body.</p><p>Definition 2 (Problem Definition). Given K = (T , A), a minimum "frequency threshold", θ f , and a minimum "fitness threshold", θ fit , we desire to discover as many frequent and fit hidden patterns (w.r.t θ f and θ fit ) as possible, in the form of relational ARs, that may induce new assertions for K.</p><p>Intuitively, a frequent hidden pattern is a generalization of a set of concept/role assertions co-occurring reasonably often (w.r.t. a fixed frequency threshold) together, showing an underlying form of correlation that is exploited for obtaining new assertions.</p><p>The rules to be discovered (following Def. 2), will be represented in the Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, which extends the set of OWL axioms with Horn-like rules. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref>Definition 3 (SWRL Rule). Given a KB K, a SWRL rule is an implication between an antecedent (body) and a consequent (head) of the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">B 1 ∧ B 2 ∧ . . . B n → H 1 ∧ • • • ∧ H m , where B 1 ∧ • • • ∧ B n is the rule body and H 1 ∧ • • • ∧ H m is the rule head. Each B 1 , . . . , B n , H 1 , . . . H m is called an atom.</formula><p>An atom is a unary or binary predicate of the form C(s), R(s 1 , s 2 ), where the predicate symbol C is a concept name in K, R is a role name in K, s, s 1 , s 2 are terms. A term is either a variable (denoted by x, y, z) or a constant (denoted by a, b, c) standing for an individual name or data value.</p><p>The discovered rules can be generally called multirelational rules since multiple binary predicates R(s 1 , s 2 ) with different role names of K could appear in a rule. The intended meaning of a rule is: whenever the conditions in the antecedent hold, the conditions in the consequent must also hold. A rule having more than one atom in the head can be equivalently transformed, due to the safety condition (see Def. 4), into multiple rules, each one having the same body and a single atom in the head. Therefore, we will consider, w.l.o.g., only SWRL rules (hereafter just "rules") with one atom in the head.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. LANGUAGE BIAS</head><p>From Def. 3, we realize that we might generate a multitude of SWRL rules with respect to a given ontological KB. In order to avoid generating trivial rules (e.g., Male(x) → Man(x)), redundant rules (e.g., fatherOf(y, x) → Male(y)) or meaningless rules (e.g., fatherOf(y, x) → parentOf(u, v)), we fix the language bias. A language bias is a set of constraints giving a tight specification of the patterns worth considering, thus allowing to reduce the search space. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, we are interested in rules having only atomic concepts and/or role names of K as predicate symbols, and individual names as constants. Only connected <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and non-redundant <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> rules satisfying the safety condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> are considered.</p><p>Given an atom A, let T (A) denote the set of all the terms occurring in A and let V (A) ⊆ T (A) denote the set of all the variables occurring in A e.g. V (C(x)) = {x} and V (R(x, y)) = {x, y}. Such notation may be extended to rules straightforwardly.</p><p>Definition 4 (Safety Condition). Given a KB K and a rule r = B 1 ∧ B 2 ∧ . . . B n → H, r satisfies the safety condition if all variables appearing in the rule head also appear in the rule body; formally if: V (H) ⊆ n i=1 V (B i ), Definition 5 (Connected Rule). Given a KB K and a rule r = B 1 ∧ B 2 ∧ . . . B n → H, r is connected if and only if every atom in r is transitively connected to every other atom in r.</p><p>Two atoms B i and B j in r, with i = j, are connected if they share at least a variable or a constant i.e. if T (B i ) ∩ T (B j ) = ∅. Two atoms B 1 and B k in r are transitively connected if there exist in r, atoms B 2 , . . . , B k-1 , with k ≤ n, such that, for all i, j ∈ {1, . . . , k} with i = j, T (B i ) ∩ T (B j ) = ∅. Definition 6 (Closed Rule). Given a KB K and a rule r = B 1 ∧B 2 ∧. . . B n → H, r is closed if and only if every variable in r is closed.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Each variable v j ∈ n i=1 V (B i ), j ∈ {1, . . . , k}, with k ≤ n, is closed if it appears at least twice in r.</formula><p>Definition 7 (Redundant Rule). Given a KB K and a rule r = B 1 ∧ B 2 ∧ . . . B n → H, r is a redundant rule if at least one atom in r is entailed by another atom in r with respect to K, i.e., if, ∃i ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n}, ∃j ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n}, with</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">B 0 = H, results: B j |= K B i , i = j</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. METRICS FOR RULE EVALUATION</head><p>We notice that the generated rules satisfying the language bias in Section III are definitely not trivial, redundant and meaningless. However, the language bias might not guarantee the quality of generated rules. Therefore, we use metrics that are a data-driven approach for assessing the quality of rules. For each metric, a threshold is used to filter low-quality rules.</p><p>So far, only a few metrics introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> are used to evaluate the quality of SWRL rules. In this paper we propose a solution that is using metrics employed for evaluating the quality of ARs to assess the quality of SWRL rules. With this solution, we might increase the number of metrics to assess the SWRL rules and in addition also support other studies related to the evaluation of SWRL rules.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Computing Metrics for Association Rules</head><p>All metrics used to evaluate ARs are computed based on the frequency counts tabulated in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">TABLE I. A CONTINGENCY TABLE FOR THE ASSOCIATION RULE X → Y Y Y X f11 f10 f1+ X f01 f00 f0+ f+1 f+0 N Table I includes two itemsets X, Y</formula><p>, where X is called antecedent and Y is called consequent; X (resp. Y ) stands for an itemset that does not contain items in the itemset X (Y ) for a transaction; f 11 is the number of times transactions contain items in both X and Y ; f 1+ counts the number of transactions that contain items in X; f +1 counts the number of transactions that contain items in Y ; N is the total number of transactions. From the four values of f 11 , f 1+ , f +1 and N , we can calculate the remaining values in the contingency table. For example, f 10 is the number of transactions that contain items in X but not in Y and f 10 = f 1+ -f 11 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Computing Metrics for SWRL Rules</head><p>In order to build metrics for assessing SWRL rules derived from metrics for evaluating ARs, we also need to build a contingency table based on frequency counts. However, instead of counting the number of transactions, we count the number of bindings of variables to individuals in the KB.</p><p>The entries in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref> are used to aid in the construction of the metrics for assessing SWRL rules. As in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>, we only need to obtain the four values E H (r), M H (r), Σ H (r) and N , the remaining values being easy to compute based on these values. Definition 8 (Binding). A binding is a mapping from a set of variables to a set of named individuals that occur in at least one assertion in the ABox.</p><p>Given a rule r = B 1 ∧ . . . ∧ B n → H, let us denote:</p><p>• Σ H (r) the set of distinct bindings of the variables occurring in the head of r, formally:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Σ H (r) = {binding V (H)}</formula><p>• E H (r) the set of distinct bindings of the variables occurring in the head of r provided the body and the head of r are satisfied, formally:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">E H (r) = { binding f of V(H) | there is a binding f' of V (B 1 ∧ • • • ∧ B n ) that extends f, such that f (B 1 ∧ • • • ∧ B n ∧ H) is satisfied}.</formula><p>Since the rules satisfy the safety condition,</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">V (H) ⊆ V (B 1 ∧ • • • ∧ B n )</formula><p>• M H (r) the set of distinct bindings of the variables occurring in the head of r also appearing as binding for the variables occurring in the body of r (since the rules satisfy the safety condition), formally:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">M H (r) = { binding f of V(H) | there is a binding f' of V (B 1 ∧ • • • ∧ B n ) that extends f, such that f (B 1 ∧ • • • ∧ B n ) is satisfied}.</formula><p>• Σ i total number of individuals inside a KB.</p><p>• The rule head of r might be either a concept atom or a role atom. Therefore, N is a number defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">N = Σ i , if H is a concept atom; P 2 Σi = Σ i (Σ i -1)</formula><p>, if H is a role atom; This, implicitly, assumes a role cannot be reflexive.</p><p>There are two kinds of metrics: symmetric and asymmetric metrics. In our work, we focus only on introducing asymmetric metrics that are suitable for assessing rules coded in SWRL, because SWRL rules have the general form B → H and values of an asymmetric metric for B → H and H → B may not be the same. We do not use symmetric metrics because these are only appropriate for evaluating itemsets of the form B ∧ H, which is equivalent to H ∧ B, without any distinction between antecedent and consequent.</p><p>Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, we redefine a few basic definitions of asymmetric metrics through the entries of Table II for use in the experiments (Sec. VI). These definitions are modified from the classical ones (as given e.g. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>) to ensure they fit the case of SWRL rules. Definition 9 (Rule Support). Given a rule r = B 1 ∧ . . . ∧ B n → H, its support is the number of distinct bindings of the variables in the head, provided the body and the head of r are satisfied jointly, formally:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">supp(r) = |E H (r)|.<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Definition 10 (Head Coverage for a Rule). Given the rule r = B 1 ∧ . . . ∧ B n → H, its head coverage is the ration between the rule support and the distinct variable bindings from the head of the rule</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">headCoverage(r) = |E H (r)| |Σ H (r)| . (<label>2</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_11">)</formula><p>Definition 11 (Rule Confidence). Given a rule r = B 1 ∧ . . . ∧ B n → H, its confidence is defined as the ratio of the number of the rule support and the number of bindings in the rule body:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">conf(r) = |E H (r)| |M H (r)| . (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_13">)</formula><p>Definition 12 (Rule PCA-Confidence). Given the rule r = B 1 ∧ . . . ∧ B n → H, its PCA (Partial Completeness Assumption) confidence is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">pcaconf(r) = |E H (r)| |M H (r)| , if H is a concept atom; |E H (r)| |P H (r)| , if H is a role atom,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where P H (r) is the set of distinct bindings of the variables occurring in the head of r provided that the body and the head of r are satisfied. In particular, this applies when a role atom is in the head of the considered rule. Formally:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">P H (r) = {binding V (H) | ∃ binding V (B 1 ∧ • • • ∧ B n ) ∪ v rng (H ) : B 1 ∧ • • • ∧ B n ∧ H }, where</formula><p>• H and H are role atoms with the same predicate symbol R;</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">• V (H) ⊆ V (B 1 ∧ • • • ∧ B n ) since rules are connected and closed • v dom (H) = v dom (H ) and v rng (H) = v rng (H );</formula><p>with v dom and v rng standing for the domain and range variables respectively of the predicate symbol R</p><formula xml:id="formula_17">• v rng (H ) / ∈ V (B 1 ∧ • • • ∧ B n ).</formula><p>Definition 13 (Certainty Factor for a Rule). Given a rule r = B 1 ∧ . . . ∧ B n → H, its Certainty Factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> represents uncertainty in the rule and is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">cf(r) =          conf(r)- |Σ H (r)| N 1- |Σ H (r)| N , if conf(r) &gt; |Σ H (r)| N ; conf(r)- |Σ H (r)| N |Σ H (r)| N , if conf(r) &lt; |Σ H (r)| N ; 0, if conf(r) = |Σ H (r)| N .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>Definition 14 (Added Value for a Rule). Given a rule r = B 1 ∧. . .∧B n → H, Added Value <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> for the rule r is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">av(r) = conf(r) - |Σ H (r)| N (<label>6</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">)</formula><p>This metric is more meaningful when the amount of evidence is large, for it relies on probabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Metrics for Evaluating Rule Precision</head><p>Definition 15 (Rule Precision). Given the rule r = B 1 ∧ . . . ∧ B n → H, its precision is the ratio of the number of correct predictions made by r and the total number of correct and incorrect predictions (predictions logically contradicting K), leaving out the predictions with unknown truth value. This metric expresses the ability of a rule to perform correct predictions, but it is not able to take into account the induced knowledge, that is the unknown predictions. For this reason, the metrics proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> are also considered (for the evaluation in Sect. VI):</p><p>• match rate: number of predicted assertions in agreement with facts in the complete ontology, out of all predictions;</p><p>• commission error rate: number of predicted assertions contradicting facts in the full ontology, out of all predictions;</p><p>• induction rate: number of predicted assertions that are not known in the complete ontology, out of all predictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. THE EDMAR ALGORITHM</head><p>Here, we use the EDMAR (Evolutionary Discovery of Multi-relational Association Rules) algorithm represented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. All the proposed metrics in this paper are in turn used as fitness function in EDMAR algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS</head><p>We carry out a comparison of the best asymmetric metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> with a combination of them. The comparative criteria are based on the number of discovered rules, the number of unknown facts and the number of correct predictions. This comparison is created with the desire to figure out a new metric that is better than the metrics in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The idea of this solution is that the metric combined by the best metrics might obtain discovered rules which satisfies at least one of the best metrics but may not satisfy the remaining metrics.</p><p>The EDMAR algorithm is applied to the same publicly available ontologies used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>: Financial, <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> describing the banking domain; Biological Pathways Exchange (BioPAX), <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref>describing biological pathway data; and New Testament Names Ontology (NTNMerged), <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> describing named entities in the New Testament. Details in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">V</ref>.</p><p>In order to assess the ability of the discovered rules to predict new assertional knowledge for a considered ontological KB, for each ontology in Table V, we construct three stratified samples by randomly removing respectively 20%, 30%, 40% of the concept assertions and eliminating role assertions or assertional axioms that involve the removed concept assertions, while the full ontology has been used as a testbed.</p><p>We carried out 30 runs of the EDMAR algorithm (cf. Sect. V) for each stratified sample and for each choice of fitness function using the following parameter setting: Our experiments aimed at comparing the results obtained by the EDMAR algorithm using the five best asymmetric metrics evaluated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> (HeadCoverage, Confidence, PCA-Confidence, Certainty Factor, Added Value) and the metric Combination metrics (r) which is a combination of these five metrics (Combination metrics (r) = HeadCoverage(r) + Confidence(r) + PCA-Confidence(r) + Certainty Factor(r) + Added Value(r)). These six metrics are used as fitness function in EDMAR algorithm and the comparison is based on the three following criteria:</p><p>1) The number of the rules discovered by the EA.</p><p>2) The induction rate: if it is positive, this means assertions are predicted that could not be inferred from the stratified version. The higher the induction rate, the more novel predictions (unknown facts) are induced for the KB.</p><p>3) The number of correct predictions = number of predictions × precision, where the number of predictions is the number of predicted assertions and precision is defined in Def. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref>.</p><p>In order to compare the metrics according to these criteria, we applied the rules discovered from the stratified samples to the full ontology versions and collected all predictions, that is the head atoms of the instantiated rules. All predictions already contained in the stratified ontology versions have been discarded while the remaining predicted facts have been considered. A prediction is regarded as correct if it is contained/entailed by the full ontology version and as incorrect if it is inconsistent with the full ontology version. Results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">IV</ref> have been averaged over 30 different runs with the above parameter setting and have been measured in terms of precision (Def. 15), match rate, commission error rate, and induction rate (Sect. IV-C).</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">III</ref> shows a comparison of the metrics according to the first criterion. The second and third criteria are used to compare the predictive power of the discovered rules and are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">IV</ref>. From the observations in Tables III and IV, we might draw a few remarks:</p><p>• The EDMAR algorithm confirms its ability to discover accurate rules (precision = match rate + commission rate + induction rate = 1) and no contradicting knowledge is predicted (commission error rate = 0) on all versions of all considered ontologies.</p><p>• The combined metric (CM) allows EDMAR to discover the largest number of rules (Tab. III) along with the largest number of correct predictions (Tab. IV) in NTNMerged that is the ontology containing the largest number of individuals (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">V</ref>). In addition, this metric comes up with rules that induce a large number of previously unknown facts (induction rate &gt; 0).  of the five best metrics and is the best choice as an optimization criterion (i.e., fitness function) for EDMAR.</p><p>In addition, we also notice that the rate of removing concept assertions, does not affect the number of discovered rules from ontological knowledge bases (Tab. III).</p><p>We also compared the experimental performance of the EDMAR algorithm using Combination metrics (r) with the two level-wise generate-and-test algorithms RARD <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and AMIE <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, which are closest to it in purpose. Table VI reports the number of rules discovered by each system given each knowledge base sample. We did not compare the second and third criteria because the maximum length of a rule in EDMAR is different from RARD and AMIE. We may remark the following:</p><p>• The metric Combination metrics (r) discovers more rules than RARD from NTNMerged, but fewer from the Financial and Biopax KBs. One reason is that EDMAR does not generate open rules as RARD; in addtion, the maximum length of a rule in EDMAR is 10 atoms while in RARD is 3 atoms. Another reason is that the number of individuals in Financial and Biopax is less than that of NTNMerged.</p><p>• The metric Combination metrics (r) is superior to AMIE because it discovers more rules than AMIE from all three KBs, although the rules discovered by AMIE can be inconsistent with KBs and the maximum length of a rule in AMIE is 3 atoms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We have shown a method to convert metrics for scoring ARs into metrics for assessing SWRL rules. In addition, we figured out the best metric to score candidate multi-relational association rules in the evolutionary approach by comparison experiment.</p><p>Future work might focus on developing other metrics suited for scenarios based on the OWA.   </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>n = 5 1 5θ</head><label>51</label><figDesc>, 000; pmut = 5%; MAX GENERATIONS = 200; θmut = 0.2; MAX RULE LENGTH = 10; τ = fit = 0 θ f = 1.</figDesc></figure>
