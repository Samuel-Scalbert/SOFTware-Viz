<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Understanding the geographic distribution of species is a key concern in conservation. By pairing species occurrences with environmental features, researchers can model the relationship between an environment and the species which may be found there. To advance research in this area, a large-scale machine learning competition called GeoLifeCLEF 2021 was organized. It relied on a dataset of 1.9 million observations from 31K species mainly of animals and plants. These observations were paired with high-resolution remote sensing imagery, land cover data, and altitude, in addition to traditional lowresolution climate and soil variables. The main goal of the challenge was to better understand how to leverage remote sensing data to predict the presence of species at a given location. This paper presents an overview of the competition, synthesizes the approaches used by the participating groups, and analyzes the main results. In particular, we highlight the ability of remote sensing imagery and convolutional neural networks to improve predictive performance, complementary to traditional approaches.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In order to make informed conservation decisions, it is essential to understand where different species live. Citizen science projects now generate millions of geo-located species observations every year, covering tens of thousands of species. But how can these point observations be used to predict what species might be found at a new location?</p><p>A common approach is to build a species distribution model (SDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which uses a location's environmental covariates (e.g. temperature, elevation, land cover) to predict whether a species is likely to be found there. Once trained, the model can be used to make predictions for any location where those covariates are available. Developing an SDM requires a dataset where each species observation is paired with a collection of environmental covariates. However, many existing SDM datasets are both highly specialized and not readily accessible, having been assembled by scientists studying particular species or regions. In addition, the provided environmental covariates are typically coarse, with resolutions ranging from hundreds of meters to kilometers per pixel.</p><p>In this work, we present the results of the GeoLifeCLEF 2021 competition which is part of the LifeCLEF evaluation campaign <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and co-hosted in Eighth Workshop on Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC8) <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> at CVPR 2021. This competition is the fourth GeoLifeCLEF challenge. In the first two editions, GeoLifeCLEF 2018 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and GeoLifeCLEF 2019 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, each observation was associated only with environmental features given as vectors or patches extracted around the observation. Like last year's competition, GeoLifeCLEF 2020 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, GeoLifeCLEF 2021 is aimed at bridging the previously mentioned gaps by (i) sharing a large-scale dataset of observations paired with high-resolution covariates and (ii) defining a common evaluation methodology to measure the predictive performance of models trained on this dataset. The dataset is based on over 1.9 million observations of plant and animal species. Each observation is paired with high-resolution remote sensing imagery -see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> -as well as traditional environmental covariates (e.g. climate, altitude and soil variables). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available dataset to pair remote sensing imagery with species observations. Our hope is that this analysis-ready dataset and associated evaluation methodology will (i) make SDM and related problems more accessible to machine learning researchers and (ii) facilitate novel research in large-scale, high-resolution, and remote-sensing-based species distribution modeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Dataset and evaluation protocol presentation</head><p>Data collection. The data for this year's challenge is the same as last year reorganized in a more easy-to-use and compact format. A detailed description of the GeoLifeCLEF 2020 dataset is provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. In a nutshell, it consists of 1,921,123 observations covering 31, 435 species (mainly plants and animals) distributed across US (1,097,640) and France (823,483), as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. Each species observation is paired with high-resolution covariates (RGB-IR imagery, land cover and altitude) as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>. These high-resolution covariates are resampled to a spatial resolution of 1 meter per pixel and provided as 256 √ó 256 images covering a 256m √ó 256m square centered on each observation. RGB-IR imagery come from the 2009-2011 cycle of the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) for the US<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> , and from the BD-ORTHO¬Æ 2.0 and ORTHO-HR¬Æ 1.0 databases from the IGN for France<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> . Land cover data originates from the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> for the US and from CESBIO <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> for France. All elevation data comes from the NASA Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> . In addition, the dataset also includes traditional coarser resolution covariates: 19 bio-climatic rasters (30arcsec 2 /pixel, i.e., 1km 2 /pixel, from WorldClim <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>) and 8 pedologic rasters (250m 2 /pixel, from SoilGrids <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>). The details of these rasters are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p><p>Train-test split. The full set of occurrences was split in a training and testing set using a spatial block holdout procedure as illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. This limits the effect of spatial auto-correlation in the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Using this splitting procedure, a model cannot perform well by simply interpolating between training samples. The split was based on a global grid of 5km √ó 5km quadrats. 2.5% of these quadrats were randomly sampled and the observations falling in those formed the test set. 10% of those observations were used for the public leaderboard on Kaggle while the remaining 90% allowed to compute the private leaderboard providing the final results of the challenge. Similarly, another 2.5% of the quadrats were randomly sampled to provide an official validation set. The remaining quadrats and their associated observations were assigned to the training set.</p><p>Evaluation metric. For each occurrence in the test set, the goal of the task was to return a candidate set of species likely to be present at that location. Due to the presence-only <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> nature of the observation data used during the evaluation of the methods, for each location in the test set, we only have the knowledge of the presence of one species -the one observed -among the different ones which can actually be found all together at that point. To measure the precision of the predicted sets while accommodating with this limited knowledge, a simple set-valued classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> metric was chosen as the main evaluation criterion: top-30 error rate. Each observation ùëñ is associated with a single ground-truth label ùë¶ ùëñ corresponding to the observed species. For each observation, the submissions provided 30 candidate labels ùë¶ ^ùëñ,1 , ùë¶ ^ùëñ,2 , . . . , ùë¶ ^ùëñ,30 .</p><p>The top-30 error rate is then computed using</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Top-30 error rate = 1 ùëÅ ùëÅ ‚àëÔ∏Å ùëñ=1 ùëí ùëñ where ùëí ùëñ = {Ô∏É 1 if ‚àÄùëò ‚àà {1, . . . , 30}, ùë¶ ^ùëñ,ùëò Ã∏ = ùë¶ ùëñ 0 otherwise</formula><p>Note that this evaluation metric does not try to correct the sampling bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> inherent to present-only observation data (linked to the density of population, etc.). The absolute value of the resulting figures should thus be taken with care. Nevertheless, this metric does allow to compare the different approaches and to determine which type of input data and of models are  useful for the species presence detection task.</p><p>Course of the challenge. The training and test data were publicly shared in early March 2021 through the Kaggle platform <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">6</ref> . Any research team wishing to participate in the evaluation could register on the platform and download the data. Each team could submit up to 3 submissions per day to compete on the public leaderboard. A submission (also called a run in the next sections) takes the form of a CSV file containing the top-30 predictions of the method being evaluated for all observations in the test set. For each submission, the top-30 error rate was first computed only on a subset of the test set to produce the public leaderboard which was visible to all the participants while the competition was still running. Once the submission phase was closed (mid-May), only 5 submissions per team were retained to compute the private leaderboard using the rest of the test set. These submissions were either hand-picked by the team or automatically chosen as the 5 best performing submissions on the public leaderboard. The participants could then see the final scores of all the other participants on the private leaderboard as well as their final ranking. Each participant was asked to provide a working note, i.e. a detailed report containing all technical information required to reproduce the results of the submissions. All LifeCLEF working notes were reviewed by at least two members of the LifeCLEF organizing committee to ensure a sufficient level of quality and reproducibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Baseline methods</head><p>Based on last year's competition, three baselines were provided by the organizers of the challenge to serve as comparison references for the participants while developing their own methods. They consisted in:</p><p>‚Ä¢ Top-30 most present species: a constant predictor returning always the same list of the most present species, i.e. the ones having the most occurrences in the training set.</p><p>‚Ä¢ RF on environmental variables: a Random Forest model trained on environmental feature vectors only, i.e. on the 27 climatic and soil variables extracted at the position of the observation. ‚Ä¢ CNN on 6-channels patches: this method <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> is the one that obtained the best result during GeoLifeCLEF 2020 competition <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. It is based on a Convolution Neural Network trained on all the high-resolution image covariates, i.e. on 6-channel tensors composed of RGB-IR images, land cover image, and altitude image.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Participants and methods</head><p>Seven teams participated to the GeoLifeCLEF 2021 challenge and submitted a total of 26 submissions: University of Melbourne, DUTH (Democritus University of Thrace), CONABIO (Comisi√≥n Nacional para el Conocimiento y Uso de la Biodiversidad), UTFPR (Federal University of Technology -Paran√°) as well as three participants for which we could not identify the affiliation and which we denote here, respectively, as Team Alpha, Team Beta and Team Gamma. The results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>. Only the winning team (University of Melbourne) submitted a working notes paper with a detailed description of the used methodology and models trained <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. We summarize hereafter the two main models they employed:</p><p>‚Ä¢ CNN on RGB patches (University of Melbourne -Run 1): this method is based on a Convolution Neural Network (ResNet50) trained on the RGB remote sensing images only. The model was first trained in an unsupervised way using MOCO on the dataset, a contrastive representation learning framework (for 20 epochs). The resulting model was then supervisely fine-tuned entirely (i.e., end-to-end) using 7 epochs of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the whole training set (validation set included). Three types of data augmentation were used to reduce overfitting: (i) random horizontal flip, (ii) random vertical flip, and (iii) RandAugment <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, an automated data augmentation optimizer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>‚Ä¢ Bi-modal CNN on RGB patches &amp; altitude (University of Melbourne -Run 2):</head><p>The CNN on RGB patches was combined with another CNN on the altitude patches (using the same ResNet50 architecture). This other CNN was also pre-trained in an unsupervised way similarly using MOCO as for the RGB-based model. The two models are then combined by concatenating the final bottleneck layer of the ResNet50 (i.e. the new layer contains 4096 neurons instead of 2048 in the mono-modal CNN on RGB patches) and the global model was fine-tuned as before on fewer epochs. Most data augmentation was removed during training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Global competition results analysis</head><p>The to show that (i) important information explaining the species composition is contained in the high-resolution patches, and, (ii) convolutional neural networks are able to capture and exploit this information. One question raised by the challenge is how to properly aggregate the different variables provided as input. Adding altitude data to the model (University of Melbourne -Run 2) provides an improvement in prediction accuracy backing the intuition that this variable is informative of the species distribution. However, aggregating all the variables does not mechanically lead to higher performance: CNN (high resolution patches) makes use of the additional land cover data but its performance is not as good as the two runs from University of Melbourne. It seems that it is important not to aggregate the features representation of those variables too early in the architectures of the networks: concatenation of higher-level features (University of Melbourne -Run 2) is more efficient than early aggregation (CNN (high resolution patches)).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Complementary analysis</head><p>In this section, we provide complementary analyses of the submitted results. These analyses are based on the complete predicted scores (the logits for every class of every test occurrence) gently provided by the University of Melbourne team <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> after the competition for both of their models. As the dataset used this year is the same as for GeoLifeCLEF 2020, some of the conclusions of last year's overview paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> still hold and we refer the reader to it. Here, we focus on other aspects of the dataset not considered previously.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In dashed red, the vertical line ùêæ = 30 corresponding to the value of ùêæ used in this year's challenge is displayed. Both metrics are nearly indistinguishable with the provided predicted scores.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Comparison of set-valued classification metrics.</head><p>As stated previously, the task considered here fits in the framework of set-valued classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. A set of species is present at each location, the model tries to predict this set, however, we are only given a single of those present species to evaluate the performance of the model. This year, the top-30 error rate was chosen as the main evaluation metric. This metric however considers that, at each location, the same number of species will be present, implicitly assuming that the species richness is uniform over the geographical extent considered. To surpass this limitation, we can relax this constraint of predicting always sets of size ùêæ by allowing to predict adaptive sets which size in average is equal to ùêæ. This type of set-valued classification is known as average-ùêæ classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref>, we compare top-ùêæ error rate to average-ùêæ error rate for all values of ùêæ. Average-ùêæ error rate is computed by finding the appropriate threshold on the scores which will result in sets of average size ùêæ on the test set. We refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> for more details. On the comparison plot, average-ùêæ error rate can only improve upon top-ùêæ error rate. However, in our case, both curves are indistinguishable. Meaning that either, average-ùêæ does not capture the proper heterogeneity of the samples between each location <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> or that the predicted scores are not good enough to estimate it properly. We tried additional probability calibration procedures such as temperature scaling <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to improve the average-ùêæ predictions but it did not provide a significant edge. Further investigation is required to understand why average-ùêæ set classifiers do not perform better on this dataset.</p><p>Kingdoms analysis. Most species are animals <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16,</ref><ref type="bibr">328)</ref> and plants <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr">035)</ref>. Due to an omission during the construction of the dataset, other kingdoms are also represented in the US, accounting for 2,072 species (mainly Fungi) but representing only 1.5% of the observations. They are thus negligible. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>, we detail the performance of the bi-modal CNN of <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> for these different kingdoms. The main evaluation metric consists of all the kingdoms mixed together. For the separate kingdoms metrics, only the test points which observed species belonging to this specific kingdom are considered. If we directly compute the metrics on the top-30 sets    <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref>, the top-30 sets are predicted for each test observation and the error rate is then computed separately for all the observations belonging to the different kingdoms. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5b</ref>, for each test observation, only the species belonging to the kingdom of the observed species are used to build the top-30 sets resulting in different top-30 sets for each kingdoms.</p><p>predicted as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref>, it would seem that the task is harder for animals than for plants. However, this gives a biased image of the difficulty of the task. A better approach is to compute separate top-30 sets for each kingdom by retaining only the species belonging to it. In this case, the predicted top-30 sets at the same location are thus different for each kingdom. The resulting error rates are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5b</ref>. In that case, animals, although containing more species and fewer observations, seem easier to predict than plants. Surprisingly, although the dataset contains few (28,573) observations from other kingdoms, they seem to be easier to predict. This is actually likely to be simply an artefact of the metric: as they are relatively few species compared to the other kingdoms, taking the top-30 most probable species is probably a too large and not very informative set. This analysis suggests that predicting separate top-ùêæ sets for each kingdom and use these sets to derive a new evaluation metric is worth considering. Note that, this might not be as direct as it seems. Indeed, it could be important to use different values of ùêæ for the different kingdoms depending of the number of species they contain and the likelihood to find several of them present at the same location. This would thus require some tweaking.</p><p>Late-fusion of models. We test the complementarity of the predictions made by the different methods by aggregating their output (the logits) in a late-fusion manner: their outputs are averaged before computing the top-30 most confident species. Here, we focus on the runs submitted by team University of Melbourne as well as the baseline CNN (high resolution patches). The results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>. As explained previously, one important difference between the baseline and the runs submitted is the way the variables are aggregated. Surprisingly, fusing the predictions of the baseline method with either the uni-modal or bi-modal model from University of Melbourne actually results in top-30 sets of significantly similar accuracy. This seems to suggest that, beyond the aggregation method, the unsupervised pre-training used by University of Melbourne might be particularly helpful for RGB data but less for altitude data  which is already fairly well exploited by the baseline. Another interesting observation is that combining the uni-modal and bi-modal models from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> provides a little additional gain of about 2% This might come up as a surprise: the bi-modal model consists essentially of the uni-modal model with additional altitude data. This additional gain might come from three factors:</p><p>‚Ä¢ the slight differences in the training of uni-modal and bi-modal models, i.e. data augmentation and training time; ‚Ä¢ the late aggregation of the altitude data with RGB images might not be perfectly suited and adding a second layer of aggregation via late-fusion might allow to recover it additional complementary information; ‚Ä¢ the variance reduction due to ensembling of similar models with high bias.</p><p>Finally, late-fusing all three models provides yet another non-negligible gain, highlighting the complementary of those different models. Further investigation could understand better where this complementary originates and help build better models.</p></div>
