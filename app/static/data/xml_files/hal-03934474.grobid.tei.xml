<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Argumentation is the process by which arguments are constructed, compared, evaluated in several respects and judged in order to establish whether any of them is warranted. Argumentation is an effective approach for solving various theoretical and practical problems (Simari and <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Rahwan, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Atkinson et al., 2017)</ref>, like explaining and justifying the decision making outcomes and reasoning under inconsistent and incomplete information. Roughly, each argument is a set of premises or assumptions that, together with a claim, is obtained by a reasoning process. The overall goal of argumentation is to increase or decrease the acceptability of claims by supporting or attacking them with new arguments.</p><p>A major component of the argumentation process concerns the assessment of a set of arguments and of their conclusions to establish their justification status, and therefore compute their acceptability degree <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baroni et al., 2011)</ref>. Both qualitative and quantitative approaches have been proposed in the literature to assess the acceptance of an argument. However, the assessment of the arguments acceptability is only a (basic) part of the complex assessment tasks required in argumentative processes in many everyday life applications and contexts, e.g., in medicine and education.</p><p>The issue of assessing an argumentation is particularly critical when considering the different aspects of artificial argumentation, from the identification of real natural language arguments and their relations in text, to the computation of the justification status of abstract arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baroni et al., 2011)</ref>, to the gradual assessment of arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Hunter, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Amgoud et al., 2022)</ref> based, e.g., on the trustworthiness of the argument proponents <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(da Costa Pereira et al., 2011)</ref> or on the value promoted by the argument <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Bench-Capon, 2003)</ref>. In particular, despite some approaches addressing the automatic assessment of natural language arguments <ref type="bibr">(Wachsmuth et al., 2017a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Wachsmuth and Werner, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Saveleva et al., 2021)</ref>, this issue remains largely unexplored and unsolved.</p><p>In this paper, we address this open issue and we answer the following research questions: (i) what are the basic quality dimensions to characterise natural language argumentation? and (ii) how to automatically assess these quality dimensions on natural language argumentative text?</p><p>More specifically, we propose an argument mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cabrio and Villata, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lawrence and Reed, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lauscher et al., 2021)</ref> approach to iden-tify and classify natural language arguments along with quality dimensions. We first define and annotate three prominent quality dimensions for natural language argumentation, i.e., cogency, rhetoric and reasonableness, on an existing dataset of student persuasive essays <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Stab and Gurevych, 2017)</ref>. More specifically, cogency estimates the acceptability of the premises that are relevant to the argument's conclusion and their sufficiency to draw the conclusion, rhetoric determines the rhetorical strategy employed in the argument's conclusion (if any), and reasonableness rates if the argument adequately rebuts its counterarguments. We then train a transfomer-based neural classifier with an attention mechanism called Longformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Beltagy et al., 2020)</ref> empowered with graph embeddings to address the task. Our core contribution is twofold:</p><p>• We enrich a linguistic resource of persuasive essays <ref type="bibr">(1908 arguments)</ref> with a new annotation layer, i.e., the quality dimensions of cogency, rhetoric and reasonableness.</p><p>• We propose a new transformer-based model architecture, exploiting the structure of the argument graph through graph embeddings, and we address an extensive evaluation obtaining good results. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that combines the graph structure of the argumentation with the textual content to assess the argumentation quality.</p><p>The work we present in this paper is motivated by the lack of existing resources of natural language argumentation annotated with quality dimensions, and the need for effective methods to address this task. Our contribution advances the state of the art with a novel resource and an effective method.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Recent approaches in Argument(ation) Mining (AM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Cabrio and Villata, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Lawrence and Reed, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Lauscher et al., 2021)</ref> tackle specific argument qualities features, such as argument relevancy <ref type="bibr">(Wachsmuth et al., 2017b)</ref>, convincing arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Habernal and Gurevych, 2016)</ref> and overall argument quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Toledo et al., 2019)</ref>. Previous work on student essays aimed to assess clarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Persing and Ng, 2013)</ref>, organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Persing et al., 2010)</ref> and argument strength <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Persing and Ng, 2015)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Luo and Litman, 2016)</ref> target the automatic prediction of the quality of student reflective responses, showing how expert-coded quality ratings and quality predictions based on their features positively correlate with student learning gain.</p><p>Defining the characteristics of a good and successful argument is a hard task. Different approaches have been proposed to assess logical, rhetorical, and dialectical quality dimensions of natural language arguments. <ref type="bibr">(Wachsmuth et al., 2017a)</ref> derive a taxonomy of argumentation quality that systematically decomposes quality assessment based on the interactions of 15 widely accepted quality dimensions. The three main characteristics are Cogency, Effectiveness and Reasonableness. As a follow up, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Wachsmuth and Werner, 2020)</ref> investigate how effectively each dimension can be automatically assessed, modelling features such as content, style, length and subjectivity. This textonly assessment yields moderate learning success for most of the evaluated dimensions. In another text-only approach, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Lauscher et al., 2020)</ref> describe a large argument quality corpus with data extracted from forums. They propose the first computational model to automatically evaluate Cogency, Reasonableness, Effectiveness and overall quality. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Saveleva et al., 2021)</ref> present an argument quality assessment method defined as a graph classification task. The authors reconstruct the graph structure of the arguments within the argument quality dataset of <ref type="bibr">(Wachsmuth et al., 2017a)</ref>, showing that this is feasible only in some cases. The reconstructed structures are composed of claims and evidence connected by a support relation, disregarding important elements like counterarguments and rebuttals. Results indicate that discourse-based argument structures reflect qualitative properties of the arguments. For rhetorical aspects, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Duthie et al., 2016)</ref> show the impact of the different rhetorical strategies used in political discourse. For Automatic Essay Scoring, <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Zhang and Litman, 2021)</ref> show how human-labelled evidence scores can be replaced with other automated essay quality signals, such as word count and topic distribution similarity.</p><p>In this paper, we advance the state of the art of natural language argument quality assessment by investigating three main quality properties of persuasive essays grounding on social science argument quality assessment scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Stapleton and Wu, 2015)</ref>. Moreover, we propose a novel method to evaluate the reasonableness of an argument by combining cogency properties with the argumentation graph structure.</p><p>To annotate the quality dimensions on persuasive essays, we rely on the corpus built by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Stab and Gurevych, 2017)</ref>, containing 402 persuasive essays annotated with the argument components (i.e., evidence, claims and major claims) and relations (i.e., support or attack). This results in 402 argument graphs where the argument components are the nodes of the graph, and the argumentative relations are the edges of the graph. We add a new annotation layer by manually labelling for each argument in the essays the following three quality attributes: cogency, reasonableness and argumentation rhetoric, following the taxonomy proposed by <ref type="bibr">(Wachsmuth et al., 2017a)</ref>. Taking advantage of the relation annotations, we use the argument graph (i.e., argument components and their relations) to assist annotators in their annotation process. Annotation guidelines. Given that our goal is to assess persuasive essays written by students, we rely on the quality evaluation process proposed in social sciences showing how these essays are assessed by professors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Stapleton and Wu, 2015)</ref> propose a scoring rubric for persuasive writing that integrates the assessment of both argumentative structural elements and reasoning quality by manually analyzing argumentative essays made by 125 students in Hong Kong. This rubric contemplates several characteristics of the standard definition of Cogency and Reasonableness, such as Relevancy, Acceptability, and Soundness as well as the presence of counterarguments and rebuttals. Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1,</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and 3 show the analytic scoring rubrics proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Stapleton and Wu, 2015)</ref>. A scale of 0, 10, 15, 20, 25 is given to assess the Cogency and Reasonableness of a given argument.</p><p>Cogency. An argument should be seen as cogent if it has individually acceptable premises that are relevant to the argument's conclusion and that are sufficient to draw the conclusion <ref type="bibr">(Wachsmuth et al., 2017a)</ref>. Annotators were provided with Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> to assess the cogency dimension. Following this definition, we define the acceptable premises as the ones that are worthy of being believed, and the relevant one as those that contribute to the acceptance or rejection of the argument's conclusionThese criteria are considered in point (b) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) whilst the structural information about the argument graph is addressed in point (a). Example 1 shows the cogency annotation on a persuasive essay from <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Stab and Gurevych, 2017)</ref>. The first sentence is the ma-jor claim, while the claim to be assessed is in bold and the premises supporting it are in italics. Example 1 is annotated with cogency score 25, given that the author presents multiple premises which are acceptable and relevant to draw a conclusion.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Stapleton and Wu, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Example 1 We should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education.</p><p>[Through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students] 1.[What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others]1. [During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred] 2. [All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life] 3.</p><p>Reasonableness. An argumentation should be seen as reasonable if it contributes to the resolution of the given issue in a sufficient way that is acceptable to the target audience <ref type="bibr">(Wachsmuth et al., 2017a)</ref>. The Analytic Scoring Rubric for Reasonableness (Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3 (Stapleton</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_6">Wu, 2015</ref>)) integrates these concepts and follows the idea of evaluating the argumentation graph with a focus on the counterarguments and their respective rebuttals.</p><p>Annotators were asked to annotate both the Reasonableness Counterargument and the Reasonableness Rebuttal for each claim in the essays which is attacked by a counterargument. Whilst the definitions of Reasonableness and Cogency are similar, the key difference is that with Cogency we evaluate the premises of the argument and with Reasonableness the whole argumentation graph involving the argument to be assessed (including its counterarguments and their rebuttals).</p><p>Assessing the Reasonableness of an argument implicates analysing its counterarguments and the related rebuttals. In the example of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, we assess the reasonableness quality dimension following Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ref>: for counterargument Claim E, we can see that no reasons, or premises, provided to support it. This falls under the criteria for Score 0 for Reasonableness Counterargument. For the rebuttal, we can see that Claim F correctly points out the weakness of the counterargument, providing an acceptable and sound premise and with a reasoning quality stronger than of the counterargument, therefore falling under the criteria for Score 25.   <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Stapleton and Wu, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Argumentation Rhetoric. Annotators were asked to evaluate at the argument level which rhetoric strategy the argument is following among ethos, logos, and pathos <ref type="bibr">(Aristotle, 2004)</ref>. Logos is the act of appealing to the audience through reasoning or logic, by citing facts and statistics, historical and literal analogies. Ethos is the act of appealing to the audience through the credibility of the author's beliefs or authority. Pathos means to persuade an audience by appealing to their emotions. Some examples of persuasive essays annotated with argumentation rhetoric are available in the Appendix. In Example 2 the claim (in bold) appeals to emotions Pathos when the author describes how "people are better taken care' in the premises 1 and 3 (in italic). In Example 3 the authors employ Ethos, we can notice that the author refers to personal experiences in premises 1 and 2. Example 4 employs Logos, the author refers to a formal study, in premise 2, in order to support its claim. Example 3 People should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy. [In personal live, we have some responsibilities towards to other people, there is nobody who likes all of these responsibilities]1. [Housework is very difficult for me, although my husband helps me some of them, but it is my responsibility]1. [I really don't like any of them, however I should do]2, [most people's lives are filled with tasks that they don't enjoy doing]3.</p><p>Example 4 Following celebrities can be dangerous for the youth. [This has an overall effect on personality and future of an individual, following celebrities blindly affects the health of adolescents.]1 [Many young people indulge themselves in drugs and start smoking at an early age]1. [In a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes]2 [Imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals]3.</p><p>Before starting the annotation process, three annotators (English speakers and experts in Argumentation Mining) carried out a training phase, during which they studied the guidelines and discussed about the ambiguities between the scores for the definitions of Cogency and Reasonableness, amongst others. Then, the annotators were presented with an argument from a persuasive essay (a Claim or Major Claim component) and its full argument graph, and they had to annotate the argument quality following the rubric scores. To prove the reliability of the annotation task, the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) has been calculated on an unseen set of 33 essays, obtaining a Fleiss' kappa of 0.68 for Cogency, 0.78 for Reasonableness Counterargument, 0.84 for Reasonableness Rebuttal and 0.85 for Argumentation Rhetoric. Despite this substantial agreement, an issue for the annotators was the difficulty to opt for a precise score, like 25 or 20. To minimize subjectivity issues in the manual annotation and the consequent noise in the training and testing phases for the automatic assessment of these scores, we decided to merge Score 25 with Score 20, and Score 15 with Score 10, reducing the number of labels to 3 (Score 0 is kept as is). We then proceeded to recompute Fleiss' kappa score, obtaining an increment for Cogency (from 0.68 to 0.86) only. For this reason, we decided to rely on a three-label score for Cogency prediction (i.e., 0, 15, 25), and to keep the more fine-grained score for <ref type="bibr">Reasonableness (i.e.,</ref><ref type="bibr">0,</ref><ref type="bibr">10,</ref><ref type="bibr">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">20,</ref><ref type="bibr">25)</ref>. The annotators performed then a reconciliation phase, during which they discussed to reach an agreement on the cases of disagreements. The rest of the annotation was carried out by one of the expert annotators. Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">4</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Automatic assessment of argumentation</head><p>An overview of the automatic argument quality assessment framework we propose is visualized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>. Starting from the persuasive essays where argument components and their relations are identified, the goal is to assess the quality of each argument (i.e., the quality of each claim). Three scores are computed: a cogency score in the range {0, 15, 25}, an argumentation rhetoric label among ethos, logos, and pathos, and a reasonableness score in the range {0, 10, 15, 20, 25}. Two different methods are combined to effectively assess the quality dimensions of the arguments: (i) the cogency score and the argumentation rhetoric labels are predicted using an attention-based neural architecture which employs the argumentation graphs through graph embeddings, and (ii) the reasonableness score is computed by means of an algorithm, combining the cogency score predicted at step (i) and the graph structure of each persuasive essay.</p><p>In the following, we present the features we extracted from the persuasive essays to predict the cogency score and argumentation rhetoric labels, the neural architecture we define to predict these two quality dimensions, and we conclude with the reasonableness algorithm used to assess this score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Cogency and rhetoric scoring assessment</head><p>For feature generation, we employ different embeddings methods ranging from static methods like GloVe <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Pennington et al., 2014)</ref> to contextualized embeddings, such as BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Devlin et al., 2019)</ref> and Longformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Beltagy et al., 2020)</ref>. To obtain the textual representation of an argument, we take all the sentences in the claim, but also those present in the related argument components. This mirrors the way humans evaluate the quality of an argument, meaning that a claim is assessed not only relying on the sentence(s) composing it but also on the sentences from the related components (i.e., those components linked to this claim by a support or an attack relation). Given that joining all these sentences for every argument component results in a document no longer than 2000 tokens per argument, we use the pre-trained model Longformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Beltagy et al., 2020)</ref> which allows us to process documents up to 4096 tokens with stateof-the-art results. For the graph embeddings, we utilize FEATHER-G (Rozemberczki and Sarkar, 2020) as our main model. To describe node neighbourhoods, this approach combines the characteris-tic functions of node attributes with random walk weights. These node-level features are pooled by mean pooling to create graph level statistics.</p><p>Transformers can be also be used to fine-tune the pre-trained model on a target dataset. To enrich our features for the Rhetoric dimension, we explored a way to obtain representations for the emotions present in the arguments. We use the model T5 <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Raffel et al., 2019)</ref> fine-tuned on the emotion recognition dataset by <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Saravia et al., 2018)</ref> for the Emotion Recognition downstream task. This approach allows us to obtain an emotion label amongst sadness, joy, love, anger, fear, or surprise. We then obtain a word embedding as a feature vector by either directly extracting the label representation from the fine-tuned model or employing the label to obtain a word embedding using GloVe.</p><p>After feature generation, we automatically assess each quality attribute. For Cogency and Reasonableness, Support Vector Machines (SVM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chang and Lin, 2011)</ref>, Random Forests <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Cutler et al., 2012)</ref>, Bidirectional LSTM-CRF <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Huang et al., 2015)</ref> and fine-tuned Longformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Beltagy et al., 2020)</ref> with an added dense layer for classification models were investigated. In our experiments, we evaluate different combinations of these methods with different combinations of the previously mentioned embeddings as an input vector.</p><p>As the majority of the arguments in our dataset have a non-rhetorical structure (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">5</ref>), the automatic Argumentation Rhetoric assessment task was divided into two different steps. First, a binary classification task to distinguish between a rhetorical and a non-rhetorical argument, and then a multi-label classification task to classify a rhetorical argument into ethos, logos or pathos. For both tasks, the implemented architectures are the same.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Reasonableness scoring assessment</head><p>Given the fact that in our dataset the majority of the essays did not present any counterarguments or, for a given counterargument, there was no rebuttal, our models did not have enough data to learn how to classify the reasonableness quality dimension. Motivated by this and by the consideration that the structure of the argumentation graph plays a main role in assessing reasonableness, we propose a novel approach to address this task. The reasonableness dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Stapleton and Wu, 2015)</ref> takes into account (i) the cogency of the counterarguments attacking the argument we want to as-sess the reasonableness of, (ii) the cogency of the rebuttals to these counterarguments (i.e., the arguments attacking the counterargument), and (iii) the relative number of rebuttals and counterarguments. This means that to effectively compute the reasonableness dimension, we need to combine the cogency-based quality of the argument components and the structure of the argumentation graph. We define the cogency function CV which assigns to each argument component A a cogency value in {0, 10, 15, 20, 25}, using the SVM plus graph embeddings approach we proposed.</p><p>Based on <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Stapleton and Wu, 2015)</ref>, we propose an algorithm (Algorithm 1 in the Appendix) to compute the reasonableness score of the arguments in our argumentation graphs. In this Rebuttal Reasonableness Score algorithm, the reasonableness score of the argument component A is 0 if (i) no attack to the counterarguments in CA of A holds (line 19), or (ii) the cogency value of the argument components defending A, i.e., attacking the counterarguments of A, is 0 (line 16).</p><p>For the remaining reasonableness scores, the reasonableness score of A is 10 if (i) at least one and less than half of its counterarguments are attacked (line 25), or (ii) the cogency score of more than half of the argument components defending it is 10 (line 22), or (iii) the cogency score of more than a half of the argument components defending it is lower than the cogency score of the counterarguments of A (line 29). The reasonableness of A is 15 if (i) all the counterarguments of A are attacked (line 32), and (ii) the cogency score of at least one of the argument components defending A is equal to or higher than 15 and at least one of the argument components defending A has a cogency score lower than 15 (line 33), and (iii) the cogency score of at least one of the argument components defending A is higher than the cogency score of the counterarguments of A and at least one of the argument components defending A has a cogency score lower than the cogency score of the counterarguments of A (lines 34 and 35, respectively). The reasonableness score of A is 20 if (i) all the counterarguments of A are attacked (line 32), and (ii) the cogency score of more than half of the argument components defending A is equal to or higher than 20, and at least one of the argument components defending A has cogency score equal to or lower than 10 (line 40), and (iii) the cogency score of more than half of the argument components de- fending A is higher than the cogency score of the counterarguments of A while one or two of the argument components defending A has cogency score equal to that of the counterarguments of A (line 41). Finally, the reasonableness score of A is 25 if (i) all the counterarguments of A are attacked (line 32), and (ii) the cogency score of all of the argument components defending A is 25 (line 45), and (iii) the cogency score of all of the argument components defending A is higher than the one of all of the counterarguments of A (line 46). Let us consider the example in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>. We aim to assess the reasonableness score of claim C. It holds that CV (E) = 0 (E is the counterargument of C) and CV (F ) = 10 (F is the rebuttal of E). Starting from the cogency scores of all the counterarguments and rebuttals of our target argument component C, we can see that if the cogency value of every rebuttal is 10 (the cogency score of claim F ), then the reasonableness of claim C is 10.</p><p>After the automatic assessment of the Cogency, Rhetoric, and Reasonableness dimensions, the obtained scores are used to help the student to improve the essay. Our pipeline ends with the automatic generation of the scores using this template: The [QUALITY DIMENSION] of this argument is assessed as being [PREDICTED SCORE] as the argument [DEFINITION] (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Evaluation</head><p>In the following, we report on the experimental setup, the obtained results and the error analysis.</p><p>Experimental Setup. For argument quality prediction, the embeddings (see Section 4) were combined with either (i) a Random Forest, (ii) a LSTM, (iii) a dense layer, or (iv) a SVM. Additionally, the best performing static and dynamic embeddings were concatenated and evaluated as if they were one single embedding. The PyTorch framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Paszke et al., 2019)</ref> version 1.10 was used for implementing the LSTM model with a learning rate selected from 0.05, 0.1, RNN layers 1, 2, dropout 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, and batch size from 8, 16, 32 and a hidden size of 128. For Longformer, BERT and T5 pre-trained models, we use the PyTorch implementation of huggingface <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Wolf et al., 2019)</ref> version 4.16.2. For the graph FEATHER-G embeddings, the Karate Club framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Rozemberczki et al., 2020)</ref> was used with the standard hyperparameters. The Scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al., 2011) framework was employed for the implementation of the Random Forest and SVM models. We trained the SVM models for each quality attribute, optimizing the Gamma and C hyperparameter (tested C range: 10 -4 to 10 3 , Gamma range: 10 -4 to 10 0 ) on the training data set given by the original split <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Stab and Gurevych, 2017)</ref> in the dataset. For the rhetoric attribute, we trained the SVM models concatenating the Longformer and FEATHER-G embeddings with the emotion word embedding. The latest was obtained by (i) running the fine-tuned T5 model to detect emotions, and (ii) either using that label as an input on Glove, or extracting directly from the model the representation of the labels by summarizing the hidden states of the last four layers in the model. To train the binary classification, we con- Results. nations. Performances are given on the test set in weighted average and macro multi-class F1-score.</p><p>Each run was repeated five times with different random seeds to assess the stability of the results and the average score is reported. For Cogency classification, a significant improvement (from .72 to .77 macro F1-score) can be seen when the FEATHER-G graph embeddings are combined with the Longformer embeddings. The best performing model (in bold) is composed of these embeddings along with a SVM model for the quality prediction scores.</p><p>For Reasonableness, due to the scarceness of counterarguments and rebuttals, no deep learning model showed a significant learning success. Following Algorithm 1, we obtain the Rebuttal Reasonableness score for each argument (computed starting from the cogency values obtained by our model, not the golden labels) yielding an accuracy of .80 and a macro F1 of .54 while a majority baseline obtains an accuracy of .78 and a macro F1 score of .18.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">7</ref> shows the results for the two steps and the full pipeline of the argumentation Rhetoric classification task. The T5 fine-tuned model with Glove embeddings shows the best performance with a .73 macro F1-score for the first step of the pipeline (i.e., the binary classification rhetoric/nonrhetoric), a .77 macro F1-score for the multi-label classification (i.e., the multi-class classification ethos/logos/pathos), and a .63 macro F1-score for the full pipeline. We observe that the performance improves for every model when we add the emotion embeddings to the input feature vector, supporting our choice of integrating a general emotion dimension into the rhetorical classification for a better embedding representation. We can also notice that the graph embeddings are not really contributing to this task, leading to a detriment of macro F1-score. This result can be explained as the persuasive rhetorical strategies relies mainly on the textual formulation of the argument component itself, without being impacted by the support and attack relations involving this component.</p><p>We addressed a comparison with the state-of-theart approaches for the Cogency assessment, despite the fact that we focus on a different dataset and divergent features (e.g., graph embeddings in our case). We retrained our model with the dataset of <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Wachsmuth and Werner, 2020)</ref> following their same configuration. In this dataset of forum data, each argument instance is associated to 3 different gold labels for Cogency, one for each annotator. They also separate them into 16 different topics and train each model with 15 of them, testing on the excluded one. We followed the same process for each annotator with our baseline model (Longformer embedding + SVM). Given that they do not provide any graph structure we cannot test our best model on their data to compare. However, the results obtained are a Mean Absolute Error of .64, .38 and .52 for Expert #1, #2 and #3, respectively. Comparing with <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Wachsmuth and Werner, 2020)</ref>, we can see that for Expert #2 our baseline model outperforms their best model (.38 vs .57). In the case of Expert #1, we obtain the same result as their baseline, and for Expert #3 we perform similarly (.52 vs .50). The results we obtained on Cogency (.78 f1) are, to the best of our knowledge, the best result obtained so far in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Wachsmuth and Werner, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Saveleva et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>Error Analysis. A common mistake for Cogency is that the scores 0 and 25 are more often correctly classified than score 15. This is due to the imbalance of score 15 given by the nature of the essays, and the complexity of the task for human annotators, as it is easier to distinguish bad from good cogency quality, but more difficult to assess a more subtle distinction. For the argumentation Rhetoric binary classification task, the model tends to misclassify the arguments as non rhetorical. This results from the imbalanced dataset, where 76% of the arguments are non-rhetorical. For the multilabel classification task, the model tends to confuse pathos arguments with ethos. This can be explained by the fact that ethos and pathos are the majority and minority classes, respectively. A further extension of the dataset with the spans of text in the argument that justify the annotated rhetorical structure could yield an improvement in the performance of sequence tagging. For Reasonableness, disagreements between the results given by the algorithm and the gold labels mostly lie in a wrong classification of the cogency score for the counterarguments and rebuttals, leading to a propagation of the error to the reasonableness score.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Concluding remarks</head><p>We presented a novel approach to the task of automatic quality assessment of natural language argumentation. We built a new resource of 402 students' persuasive essays annotated with 3 different quality dimensions, i.e., cogency, rhetoric and reasonableness. Through our extensive evaluation, we show that our neural architecture relying on a transformer with an attention mechanism and graph embeddings is able to successfully classify arguments along with these quality dimensions, outperforming standard baselines and similar approaches in the literature. Our quality assessment method conjugates the empirical evaluation of the cogency dimension with the graph-based computation of the reasonableness one, which encompasses the quality (expressed in terms of cogency) of the counterarguments and the argumentation structure.</p><p>In the context of AI in education, we aim to include our automatic argument quality assessment pipeline into a larger framework where the system engages the student into an explanatory rule-based dialogue to assess her essays, explain why they obtained a certain quality score and how to improve them along with the considered quality dimensions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>In this section, we discuss the main limitations of the proposed approach to automatically assess argumentation quality along with the three quality dimensions of Cogency, Reasonableness and Rhetoric.</p><p>First, we cannot directly compare our results with the few existing approaches in the literature for this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Wachsmuth and Werner, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Saveleva et al., 2021)</ref> by empirically testing our approach on the existing datasets for argumentation quality. This is due to the fact that existing datasets annotated with argument quality dimensions do not have the graph structure available (i.e., argument components and their relations) but only the text of each argument component separately. A further annotation effort to include argument relations in these datasets would allow us to evaluate our approach on these datasets too.</p><p>Secondly, the three argument quality aspects we assessed are general to argumentation and fit well for characterizing persuasive essays but may lack depth when evaluating arguments in other domains. For instance, a good argument in evidence-based medicine may not be characterised only in terms of Cogency, Reasonableness and Rhetoric. Further dimensions need to be defined according to each different domain and precise use case scenarios.</p><p>Finally, the lack of counterarguments and rebuttals in the persuasive essays dataset makes it difficult for any automatic method to learn the reasonableness assessment task. More data on these classes would improve not only the training of such models, but would also enable more evaluation cases of the proposed algorithm.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>multiple reasons for the counterargument claim(s)/alternative view(s), and b.
