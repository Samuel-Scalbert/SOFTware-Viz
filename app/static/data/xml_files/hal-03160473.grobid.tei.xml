<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>An Electronic Health Record (EHR) is a digital version of the patient's medical information. EHR data open new perspectives, especially with the development of machine learning. EHR data can be used to train predictive models in order to predict patient's medical conditions and help medical doctors to develop appropriate care <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</p><p>However, medical data is considered as sensitive information that can lead to some real and serious damage to the patient if any leakage happens. For example, medical data can be exploited by insurance companies to adapt their insurance fees, by banks to deny loans, or by politicians to discredit their opponents. Therefore, the privacy of such kind of sensitive data must be guaranteed and privacy-preserving predictive models are needed.</p><p>Predictive models are typically built using machine learning algorithms that are trained on centralized datasets. When a model is trained on multiple datasets, collected for example by several hospitals, the centralization of all datasets on a single server introduces additional, and often unacceptable, privacy risks. To mitigate this problem, Federated learning (FL) was proposed as a new learning protocol. Federated Learning consists of distributing the learning process on the different entities providing data: instead of aggregating the data on a single server, the training is performed locally by each participating entities and the models are then shared and aggregated <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>. Although Federated Learning mitigates the privacy risks by design, recent results have shown that some attacks, such as membership and property inference attacks, are still possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. Moreover, complete training samples can also be reconstructed purely from the captured gradients <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44]</ref>.</p><p>Furthermore, since participating entities must collaborate by exchanging their model updates, the required bandwidth during the training phase is often significant and prohibitive <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p><p>Contribution. This paper proposes a bandwidth-efficient privacypreserving Federated Learning scheme that provides theoretical privacy guarantees. Our proposal guarantees Differential Privacy with practical utility even on highly imbalanced training data. This is challenging as imbalanced data increases the injected noise required by Differential Privacy and hence substantially degrades model quality. Our solution relies on the extreme quantization of the gradients in order to reduce communication costs as well as on downsampling of mini-batches to diminish the noise needed for Differential Privacy. We experimentally evaluate the performance of our solution for in-hospital mortality prediction using real EHR data, containing about one million records of patients. Our results suggest that patient-level privacy can be enforced at the expense of only a moderate loss of prediction accuracy. Outline. We describe the background in Section 2. We introduce our privacy-preserving scheme in Section 3. We report on experiments with real-world data in Section 4. Finally we discuss related works in Section 5 before concluding in Section 7.</p></div>

At each round of the training, some clients retrieve the global model from the parameter server, update the global model based on their own training data, and send back their updated model to the server. The server aggregates the updated models of all clients to obtain a global model that is re-distributed to some selected parties in the next round.</p><p>In particular, a subset K of all 𝑁 clients are randomly selected at each round to update the global model, and 𝐶 = |K|/𝑁 denotes the fraction of selected clients. At round 𝑡, a selected client 𝑘 ∈ K executes 𝑇 gd local gradient descent iterations on the common model w 𝑡-1 using its own training data 𝐷 𝑘 (𝐷 = ∪ 𝑘 ∈K 𝐷 𝑘 ), and obtains the updated model w 𝑡 , where the number of weights is denoted by 𝑛 (i.e., |w 𝑡 | = |Δw 𝑡 | = 𝑛 for all 𝑘 and 𝑡). Each client 𝑘 submits the update Δw 𝑡 = w 𝑡w 𝑡-1 to the server, which then updates the common model as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">w 𝑡 = w 𝑡 -1 + 𝑘 ∈K |𝐷 𝑘 | 𝑗 |𝐷 𝑗 | Δw 𝑘 𝑡 ,</formula><p>where |𝐷 𝑘 | is known to the server for all 𝑘 (a client's update is weighted with the size of its training data). The server stops training after a fixed number of rounds 𝑇 cl , or when the performance of the common model does not improve on a held-out data.</p><p>Note that each 𝐷 𝑘 may be generated from different distributions (i.e., Non-IID case), that is, any client's local dataset may not be representative of the population distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. This can happen, for example, when not all output classes are represented in every client's training data. The federated learning of neural networks is summarized in Alg. 1. In the sequel, each client is assumed to use the same model architecture. </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">12 w 𝑘 𝑡 = SGD(𝐷 𝑘 , w 𝑘 𝑡 -1 ,𝑇 gd ) Output: Model update (w 𝑘 𝑡 -w 𝑘 𝑡 -1 )</formula><p>The motivation of federated learning is three-fold: first, it aims to provide confidentiality of each participant's training data by However, several prior works have demonstrated that model updates do leak potentially sensitive information <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>. Hence, simply not sharing training data per se is not enough to guarantee their confidentiality.</p></div>

The Gaussian Mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> consists of adding Gaussian noise to the true output of a function. In particular, for any function 𝑓 : D → R 𝑛 , the Gaussian mechanism is defined as adding i.i.d Gaussian noise with variance (Δ 2 𝑓 •𝜎) 2 and zero mean to each coordinate value of 𝑓 (𝐷).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">TOWARD FEDERATED LEARNING RECORD-LEVEL PRIVACY 3.1 The FL-SIGN Protocol</head><p>In the FL-STANDARD scheme, presented in Section 2.1, each selected client sends its updated model to the central server. As discussed previously, this scheme has several drawbacks in terms of bandwidth and privacy. We propose to limit these drawbacks by quantizing the model weights as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. More specifically, in the new scheme, referred to as FL-SIGN in the rest of this paper, each client sends only the sign of every coordinate value in its parameter update vector. The server takes the sign of the sum of signs per coordinate and scales down the result with a fixed constant 𝛾 (which is in the order of 10 -3 in practice) in order to limit the contribution of each client and adjust convergence. This scaled aggregated updates are added to the global model. More specifically, FL-SIGN (see Alg. 3) differs from the standard federated scheme FL-STANDARD (see Alg. 1) as follows:</p><p>(1) Each client returns s 𝑘 𝑡 = sign(ww 𝑘 𝑡 -1 ) instead of (ww 𝑘 𝑡 -1 ), where sign : R 𝑛 → {-1, 1} 𝑛 returns the sign of each coordinate value of the input vector if it is non-zero and a sign chosen uniformly at random otherwise. (2) The server sums the sign vectors s 𝑘 𝑡 sent by each client 𝑘 and computes the sign vector of this sum as sign 𝑘 s 𝑘 𝑡 . This is equivalent to take the median of all clients' signs at every position of the update vectors. Unlike in Alg. 1, the update s 𝑘 𝑡 is not weighted with client 𝑘's data size |𝐷 𝑘 |, since that would require the client to send |𝐷 𝑘 | to the server which would enable the adversary to maliciously scale up its sign vector by sending a fabricated size of its training data.</p><p>The extreme quantization performed by FL-SIGN reduces the communication costs of federated learning by a factor of 32 (since only one bit is sent per parameter instead of 32 bits). Note also that, if the quantized update vector is sparse, other lossless or lossy compression techniques can further improve communication efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Privacy-Preserving FL-SIGN (FL-SIGN-DP)</head><p>In FL-SIGN, a participant only sends the signs of its updates, as opposed to their actual values, hence it intuitively reveals less information about the client's dataset than the original FL-STANDARD scheme. In order to experimentally validate this intuition, we implemented the inference attack described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> on FL-STANDARD and FL-SIGN <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">1</ref> . Results showed that the attack accuracy dropped from 92% for FL-STANDARD to 50% for FL-SIGN. While these results suggest that privacy could be preserved in practice, they do not provide any strong guarantee.</p><p>To reason about the general privacy guarantee of FL-SIGN more rigorously, consider the sign vector s 𝑘 𝑡 = sign(w 𝑘 𝑡w 𝑘 𝑡 -1 ). Several attacks have demonstrated <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref> that Δw 𝑘 𝑡 = w 𝑘 𝑡w 𝑘 𝑡 -1 can be used to infer the membership of individual records in the training data due to the strong memorization property of neural networks, and overfitting in general. As taking the sign of Δw 𝑘 𝑡 is a deterministic operation and depends on the value of s 𝑘 𝑡 , there is no guarantee that s 𝑘 𝑡 does not leak any sensitive information. In order to obtain theoretically private schemes, we extend FL-SIGN with Differential Privacy. Our goal is to design a differentially private scheme that is accurate and also bandwidth efficient (even for small 𝜀 values).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1">Privacy and Adversarial Models.</head><p>We consider an adversary, or a set of colluding adversaries, who can access any update vector sent by the server or any clients at each round of the protocol. The adversary is computationally unbounded but passive (i.e., honestbut-curious), that is, it follows the learning protocol faithfully and does not modify any update vector. A plausible adversary is a participating entity, i.e. a malicious client or server, that wants to infer the training data used by other participants.</p><p>We aim at developing a solution that protects each record of the clients' training datasets. For example, in the scenario of collaborating hospitals we aim at protecting each individual patient record of all hospital datasets. </p><formula xml:id="formula_3">11 w𝑘 𝑡 = DPSGD(𝐷 𝑘 , w 𝑘 𝑡 -1 , 𝑆, 𝜎,𝑇 gd ) Output: sign( w𝑘 𝑡 -w 𝑘 𝑡 -1 )</formula><p>The adversary should not be able to learn from the received model or its updates whether any particular record was used to train the model by any other participants.</p><p>We believe that this adversarial model is reasonable for the medical application that we consider in this paper: it is very unlikely that a participating hospital will take the risk of manipulating the updates that it sends to the server. However, we want to make sure that it can not infer any sensitive information from the models that it receives from the server. In other words, we make the assumption that hospitals may be "curious", but are "honest".</p><p>We use Differential Privacy (DP) because it was proposed to achieve this goal. DP guarantees plausible deniability. Therefore, any negative privacy impact on an individual, i.e. a patient in the dataset, cannot be attributed to his involvement in the training phase (up to 𝜀 and 𝛿). For example, if an insurance company accesses the model updates or the common model and decides to increase the price of a patient's insurance fee, it cannot be because of the patient's data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2">Operation.</head><p>To guarantee differential privacy for any individual record of a training data, we propose FL-SIGN-DP, depicted in Alg. 4, which is a synergy of FL-SIGN and differentially private gradient descent (DPSGD) from <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. In particular, instead of running traditional SGD on its local training data, every client executes DPSGD (depicted in Alg. 6), which guarantees that its output w𝑘 𝑡 does not leak any information that is specific to a single training sample (up to 𝜀 and 𝛿) by clipping the 𝐿 2 -norm of the gradients and perturbing the result with Gaussian noise. The noise scale is calibrated to 𝑆 and 𝜎, where the latter directly gives 𝜀 and 𝛿 as shown below. Hence, any further computation which uses w𝑘 𝑡 is also differentially private.</p><p>Notice that the batch is created using downsampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> (see Alg. 7) in order to overcome the imbalanced classes of the training data. Downsampling guarantees that every batch contains identical number of samples from every class, and therefore they have similar magnitude of gradients on average.</p><p>Likewise FL-SIGN, FL-SIGN-DP also sends only signs for aggregation, and hence is equally bandwidth efficient.</p></div>

The ICD9 codes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> are composed of procedures and diagnosis codes, the first gives details about the medical procedures performed on the patient and the second about the doctor's diagnosis of the patient. There is a total of 24,419 possible drugs and ICD9 codes.  <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">5</ref> . For drugs, we extract 24,419 features which correspond to the different drugs (name and dosage). A given patient receives only a few of the possible drugs served, resulting in a very sparse patient's record. We use a MinMax normalization for age and MRCI in order to rescale the values of these features between 0 and 1 (using MinMaxScaler class of scikit-learn <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">6</ref> ). The labels that we consider are boolean: true means that the patient died during his hospital stay while false means she survived. (2) Hospitals filtering: The dataset contains 415 hospitals, however, we choose to consider only hospitals with at least 1,000 patients, which results at the end in 314 hospitals. The reason is to have enough data per hospital for both training and testing. We split randomly the dataset of each hospital into disjoint training and testing data (80% and 20% respectively). We merge the test data of all hospitals for the evaluation, which we consider fairer than averaging the metrics over all the clients (hospitals). The final dataset for testing contains 244,627 patients, with 7,891 deceased patients and 236,736 non-deceased patients (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>). The statistics on the size of the clients' dataset are depicted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ref>. (3) Patients filtering: We consider patient and drug information of the first day at the hospital so that we can make predictions 24 hours after admission (as commonly found in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>). We filter out the pregnant and new-born patients because the medication types and admission services are not the same for theses two categories of patients. Our model prediction is built without patients' historical medical data. This has the advantage to require minimum patient's information and to work for new patients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Imbalanced data.</head><p>The dataset of each hospital is imbalanced because the proportion of patients that leave the hospital alive is, fortunately, much larger than in-hospital dead patients. To deal with this well-known problem, a standard solution is to use the Weighted loss function technique or different sampling techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref> the authors compare empirically the performance of the weighted loss technique and the sampling techniques, however, they were not able to define a clear winner as the results differ for each dataset. In our case, weighted loss<ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">7</ref> outperforms downsampling <ref type="foot" target="#foot_8">8</ref>technique with FL-STANDARD and FL-SIGN. However, weighting the loss function results in very inaccurate models with Differential Privacy. Indeed, the gradients of the underrepresented class (dead patients) are boosted and are therefore larger than the gradients of the other class. The larger the gap between the gradients of the two classes, the more difficult to choose a single clipping threshold 𝑆 to guarantee Differential Privacy. In particular, if 𝑆 is calibrated to large gradients (i.e., that of samples from the under-represented class), the added Gaussian noise, whose variance is 𝑆 2 𝜎 2 , will also be large yielding poor model accuracy. On the other hand, if 𝑆 is calibrated to the small gradients (i.e., that of samples from the over-represented class), then samples from the under-represented class will have very small impact on the training which eventually also results in weak model accuracy (the model will be biased towards the majority class).</p><p>Instead, as it is described in Section 3.2, we use downsampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref> which does not require re-weighting the loss and hence overcomes the above artifact caused by clipping (see Alg. 7 for more details).

A single federated run is composed of 300 rounds, and the best and the worst value of each performance metric over the 5 federated runs are reported.

These results are consistent with the results reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, which uses the same dataset with the same features to train a logistic regression model in a centralized manner (see results of 𝐷 1 , Table <ref type="table">II</ref>, in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>). For example, Au-ROC is 77.2% -77.7% in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>  <ref type="table">6</ref>: Summary of results. The worst and best value of each metric over 5 federated runs are reported.</p><p>82% -84%, 79% -81% and 76% -77% with CENTRALIZED, FL-STANDARD and FL-SIGN, respectively.</p><p>• The performance of FL-SIGN is slightly worse than the performance of FL-STANDARD; the balanced accuracy is 0.70 for FL-SIGN and 0.74 for FL-STANDARD. However, FL-SIGN and FL-SIGN-DP reduce the bandwidth consumption by a factor of 32. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_8">7</ref> shows that each client sends only 1.76 Megabytes with FL-SIGN and FL-SIGN-DP, while 56.48 Megabytes are sent with FL-STANDARD and FL-STANDARD-DP. The bandwidth consumption is calculated by measuring the average number of bits sent by a client to the server over the rounds when the client is selected for aggregation. This is computed as (𝐶 • 𝑇 cl • model_size) for FL-SIGN and FL-SIGN-DP, and (32 • 𝐶 • 𝑇 cl • model_size) for FL-STANDARD and FL-STANDARD-DP, where model_size is the number of model parameters (i.e., 4,926,201). • FL-SIGN-DP performs very similarly to FL-STANDARD-DP, which means that bandwidth efficiency has no real cost when Differential Privacy is also applied. In fact, the performance gap between FL-STANDARD and FL-STANDARD-DP is larger than between FL-SIGN and FL-SIGN-DP especially with stronger privacy guarantee (i.e., smaller 𝜀). This shows that taking the sign of the noisy update and then the median of the noisy signs over all clients on the server (in Line 8 of Alg.4) is more robust against perturbation than taking the simple average of the noisy update vectors (in Line 8 of Alg. 5). • The results show in general that strong privacy protection can be provided at the cost of a relatively small performance degradation. In fact, the balanced accuracy drops by only 10% when 𝜀 = 1 with FL-SIGN-DP. Furthermore, the performance degrades very smoothly as the value of 𝜀 decreases (i.e. as the privacy guarantee gets stronger): the balanced accuracy of FL-SIGN-DP is 0.66 for 𝜀 = 4, and only drops to 0.64 when 𝜀 = 1.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Bandwidth Optimization in Federated Learning</head><p>Different quantization methods have been proposed to save the bandwidth and reduce the communication costs in federated learning. They can be divided into two main groups: unbiased and biased methods. The unbiased approximation techniques use probabilistic quantization schemes to compress the stochastic gradient and attempt to approximate the true gradient value as much as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>[42][40] <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. However, biased approximations of the stochastic gradient can still guarantee convergence both in theory and practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>. In signSGD <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, all the clients calculate the stochastic gradient based on a single mini-batch and then send the sign vector of this gradient to the server. The server calculates the aggregated sign vector by taking the median (majority vote) and sends the signs of the aggregated signs back to each client. The main differences between our scheme (FL-SIGN) and signSGD are as follows:</p><p>• FL-SIGN aims to train a common model that is distributed to a random subset of all clients in every round. However, in signSGD, all clients start with the same initialized common model and the server sends the same aggregated model update to every client at each round. Selecting only a random subset of clients in each round has at least three benefits. First, FL-SIGN becomes more robust against temporary node failures. Second, FL-SIGN reduces the communication costs upstream to the server. Finally, sampling boosts privacy due to the uncertainty that a specific user's or client's data is used for training or not. • In FL-SIGN, each client can perform multiple SGD iterations locally using multiple mini-batches before computing the model update. In contrast, signSGD always performs one local SGD iteration with a single mini-batch at every client. • As all the clients participate at each round in signSGD, the server only transfers the sign of the aggregated signs to the clients in every round. Therefore, only a single bit is transferred per parameter downstream to the clients. In FL-SIGN, the whole model is transferred but only to a random subset of clients.</p></div>

Indeed, the noise is added by each client during the training, and then the noisy update is sent to the server. The sum of these noisy updates is sufficiently noised to provide differential privacy. To protect individual updates which are not differentially private, homomorphic encryption is used to guarantee that the adversary can only access the aggregated update which is sufficiently noised. Notice that the noise can be generated distributively, because each client performs only a single minibatch to compute their model update (i.e., 𝑇 gd = 1). By contrast, our approach (FL-SIGN-DP) works even if 𝑇 gd &gt; 1 at the cost of adding larger magnitude of noise and sends only signs for aggregation.</p><p>The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proposed a solution which faithfully follows the SignSGD protocol but is not based on federated learning protocol. The authors use local DP to guarantee client-level-DP. However, it is widely accepted that the large noise needed for local DP decreases accuracy significantly, as the aggregation of the DP updates increases the noise variance. The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> adapts the SignSGD protocol to federated learning for a client-level-DP guarantee. The proposed scheme adds noise in a distributed manner such that the final noise after the aggregation corresponds to the minimum noise needed to ensure DP.

Our solution improves the state of the art as it provides record-level privacy guarantee and optimizes bandwidth efficiency by sending only one bit per parameter.

We experimentally evaluate the performance of our solution for in-hospital mortality prediction using the Premier Healthcare database, containing about one million records of patients. We consider a scenario where 314 hospitals are collaborating to train, using our Federated Learning scheme, a prediction model without exchanging any of their patients' data. Our scheme guarantees that no internal or external adversary that has access to the final model, intermediate updates or even all the messages that are exchanged during the training phase can infer any information about any of the patient data that were used by each hospital.</p><p>The accuracy performance results are very encouraging. They show in general that strong privacy protection can be provided at the cost of a relatively small performance degradation. Furthermore, our scheme reduces the bandwidth consumption by a factor of 32 compared to standard federated learning schemes, reducing it from 56.48 to 1.76 Megabytes.</p><p>We believe that this paper reports the first large-scale experimental assessment in favor of using privacy-preserving federated learning for the purpose of in-hospital mortality prediction. We demonstrate that it is possible to benefit from the power of machine learning without sacrificing the privacy of patients. Hospitals, and other medical institutions, are reluctant to collaborate because they often consider their patient medical records as their own intellectual properties. Our scheme protects these intellectual properties of participating entities on record-level.</p></div>

Observe that g has two sources of randomness; (1) the stochasticity of the sampling mechanism which is modelled by the stochastic gradient oracle (see Assumption 3), and (2) the Gaussian noise that is introduced in order to guarantee DP. Importantly, these are independent sources of randomness. Therefore, the probability that a vote fails for the 𝑖 𝑡ℎ parameter is bounded asP [𝑍 𝑖 ≤ 𝑀/2] ≤ E[( g𝑖 -𝑔 𝑖 ) 2 ] √ 𝑀 |𝑔 𝑖 | ≤ 𝜏 2 𝑖 + 𝑆 2 𝜎 2 √ 𝑀 |𝑔 𝑖 | (by independence) ≤ 𝜏 𝑖 + 𝑆𝜎 √ 𝑀 |𝑔 𝑖 |where the second inequality follows from Assumption 3 and the fact that the variance of the Gaussian noise is 𝑆 2 𝜎.
