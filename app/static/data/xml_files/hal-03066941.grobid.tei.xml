<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Federated Learning allows distributed entities to train a common model collaboratively without sharing their own data. Although it prevents data collection and aggregation by exchanging only parameter updates, it remains vulnerable to various inference and reconstruction attacks where a malicious entity can learn private information about the participants' training data from the captured gradients. Differential Privacy is used to obtain theoretically sound privacy guarantees against such inference attacks by noising the exchanged update vectors. However, the added noise is proportional to the model size which can be very large with modern neural networks. This can result in poor model quality. In this paper, compressive sensing is used to reduce the model size and hence increase model quality without sacrificing privacy. We show experimentally, using 2 datasets, that our privacy-preserving proposal can reduce the communication costs by up to 95% with only a negligible performance penalty compared to traditional non-private federated learning schemes.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Traditional training of machine learning models usually requires the centralization of the user-held data. This limitation is considerably penalizing especially when the data is sensitive such as medical data. To deal with this problem, federated learning protocols have been proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> to collaboratively train a common model without sharing any private training data held by individual parties. In federated learning, each entity trains a common model using its own training data, and share only the gradients (i.e., model update) with each other through a central server. The server updates the common model with the shared gradients, and re-distributes the updated model to the clients for further training. This process repeats until the convergence of the common model.</p><p>However, sharing gradients computed by individual parties can leak information about their private training data. Several recent attacks have demonstrated that a sufficiently skilled adversary, who can capture the model updates (gradients) sent by individual parties, can infer whether a specific record <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> or a group property <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> is present in the dataset of a specific party. Moreover, complete training samples can also be reconstructed purely from the captured gradients <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</p><p>Differential privacy (DP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> has become a de facto privacy model which provides a formal privacy guarantee for any participant. It guarantees that the common model is roughly independent of any single client's training data, and depends only on the characteristics that are shared among multiple parties' training data <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . DP can be achieved by adding Gaussian noise to the shared model updates. In addition, secure aggregation protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> allow parties to add noise to the model update in a distributed manner, which increases robustness against byzantine attacks and requires less noise than other decentralized perturbation approaches such as randomized response <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> used in local differential privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p><p>However, the norm of the added noise is proportional to the model size (i.e., the number of model parameters or weights). Indeed, the noise is added to every coordinate value of the gradient (update) vector including those which have very small magnitude and would anyway not improve convergence. In other words, adding noise to sparse model updates can slow down convergence significantly, or result in poor model quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>In this paper, we propose to first lossily compress the gradients using compressive sensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and then add noise to the compressed gradient vector. The noisy compressed vectors are then transferred to the server for aggregation. This approach has several benefits. First, compressed gradients are less sparse and also shorter than the original gradient vectors. This allows to add less noise to the compressed gradients, which eventually yields faster convergence with more accurate models than the uncompressed noisy gradients. Second, compressive sensing is linear, which means that the sum of compressed gradients equals the compressed sum of the gradients. Therefore, compressive sensing can be smoothly integrated with secure aggregation; the server can only access the aggregated compressed vectors which is identical to the compressed aggregation. Finally, by decreasing the size of the model updates, communication costs are reduced and bandwidth is saved. This is crucial with resource constrained parties training large models which is not uncommon nowadays.</p><p>The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:</p><p>• We use a slighlty modified version of compressive sensing to compress sparse model updates in federated learning. Our protocol, called FL-CS allows to save bandwidth and reduce communication costs by transferring only the low frequency components of the gradient vector to the server (instead of some random frequency components like in traditional compressive sensing). The server can reconstruct the approximated sparse gradient vector by efficiently solving a convex quadratic optimization problem. This approach provides more accurate reconstruction than simply applying the inverse Fourier transform on the low frequency components. Our approach is scalable to large gradient vectors and is almost as accurate as the vanilla federated learning protocol, referred to FL-STD, without any compression, still incuring much smaller communication cost.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>We propose a privacy-preserving extension of FL-CS, called FL-CS-DP, by adding Gaussian noise to the compressed gradients. In FL-CS-DP, participants inject Gaussian noise in a distributed manner so that the sum of the noisy compressed vectors is differentially private. In addition, secure aggregation guarantees that the server (or any other third party) can only learn the noisy compressed aggregate owing to the linear compression scheme. Reconstructing the approximated gradients is an instance of Basis Pursuit Denoising (or LASSO), which can be solved with efficient solvers that provide large accuracy despite the added Gaussian noise. We show that FL-CS-DP produces more accurate models than FL-STD-DP, that is, the differentially private variant of the vanilla federated learning protocol without any compression. Therefore, compression boosts the accuracy of differentially private federated learning and also reduces bandwith cost by more than 60% with early stopping <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>We evaluate our proposals on real datasets, a private medical dataset of 1.2 millions of US hospital patients and the public Fashion-MNIST dataset. We show that FL-CS-DP reduces its bandwidth cost with more than 60% compared to FL-STD-DP, meanwhile suffering negligible performance loss compared to uncompressed federated learning without any privacy guarantee (FL-STD).</p></div>

At each round of the training, a selected set of clients retrieve the global model from the parameter server, update the global model based on their own training data, and send back their updated model to the server. The server aggregates the updated models of all clients to obtain a global model that is re-distributed to some selected parties in the next round.</p><p>In particular, a subset K of all N clients are randomly selected at each round to update the global model, and </p><formula xml:id="formula_0">w t = w t-1 + k∈K |D k | j |Dj | ∆w k t ,</formula><p>where |D k | is known to the server for all k (a client's update is weighted with the size of its training data). The server stops training after a fixed number of rounds T cl , or when the performance of the common model does not improve on a held-out data.</p><p>Note that each D k may be generated from different distributions (i.e., Non-IID case), that is, any client's local dataset may not be representative of the population distribution <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This can happen, for example, when not all output classes are represented in every client's training data. The federated learning of neural networks is summarized in Alg. 1. In the sequel, each client is assumed to use the same model architecture. 12</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">w k t = SGD(D k , w k t-1 , T gd ) Output: Model update (w k t -w k t-1 )</formula><p>The motivation of federated learning is three-fold: first, it aims to provide confidentiality of each participant's training data by sharing only model updates instead of potentially sensitive training data. Second, in order to decrease communication costs, clients can perform multiple local SGD iterations before sending their update back to the server. Third, in each round, only a few clients are required to perform local training of the common model, Output: Model w which further diminishes communication costs and makes the approach especially appealing with large number of clients. However, several prior works have demonstrated that model updates do leak potentially sensitive information <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Hence, simply not sharing training data per se is not enough to guarantee their confidentiality.</p></div>

That is, for any record owner, a privacy breach is unlikely to be due to its participation in the dataset. Moments Accountant. Differential privacy maintains composition; the privacy guarantee of the k-fold adaptive composition of A 1:k = A 1 , . . . , A k can be computed using the moments accountant method <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. In particular, it follows from Markov's inequality that Pr <ref type="figure">(A,</ref><ref type="figure">D,</ref><ref type="figure">D ,</ref><ref type="figure">O</ref>))] is the log of the moment generating function of the privacy loss.

There are a few ways to achieve DP, including the Gaussian mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. A fundamental concept of all of them is the global sensitivity of a function <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The Gaussian Mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> consists of adding Gaussian noise to the true output of a function. In particular, for any function f : D → R n , the Gaussian mechanism is defined as adding i.i.d Gaussian noise with variance (∆ 2 f • σ) 2 and zero mean to each coordinate value of f (D).

Ψ can denote any linear transformation, such as Discrete Fourier/Cosine or Wavelet Transform, which render the original signal x sparse. If x is already sparse, then Ψ can be the identity matrix which corresponds to the canonical sparsity basis.</p><p>In CS, x is reconstructed from some of its linear measurements. For m measurements, the signal is "sampled" in m values y j = φ j , x (1 ≤ j ≤ m), where the vectors φ j ∈ R n constitute the sensing basis matrix Φ = (φ 1 , φ 2 , . . . , φ m ) ∈ R m×n . Here, m = r×n, where r is the compression ratio. Therefore, the compression operator C is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">C(x, m) = y = Φx = ΦΨs = Θs (<label>3</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_10">)</formula><p>where Θ is the sparsity sensing matrix. There are several options to select the sensing matrix Φ. When Φ is a random matrix (e.g., each element of Φ is an iid sample from G(0, 1/m)), then Ψ works well with an arbitrary sparsity basis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. On the other hand, the numerical reconstruction of x in that case has a complexity of O(mn) which can be very large (recall that n is the model size in the order of 10 6 ). Another (faster) option for the sensing matrix Φ is when it is composed of random m rows of the matrix of the (real) Discrete Fourier/Cosine Transform. Then, matrix multiplication can be executed with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in O(n ln n), but such sensing matrix provides accurate reconstruction if Ψ is the identity matrix, i.e. x is already sparse <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. Fortunately, this usually holds for gradient vectors (or can be made as such by sparsification without significantly affecting convergence) and hence we will use this option in this paper.</p><p>In order to recover s from y, one has to solve a system of linear equations with m equations and n unknowns. Although this system seems underdetermined because m &lt; n, CS exploits the U -sparsity of s for the reconstruction. It aims to reconstruct the sparse vector s from y = Θs given the sparsity sensing basis Θ by solving the following optimization problem:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">arg min s s 0 s.t. y = Θs</formula><p>Since this optimization problem is NP-complete <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, it is further relaxed into the following slightly different problem called Basis Pursuit (BP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">arg min s s 1 s.t. y = Θs</formula><p>Indeed, the convex L 1 -norm usually approximates the non-convex L 0 -norm well, and the relaxed optimization problem can be efficiently solved with any convex optimization technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> (e.g., with an LP solver).</p><p>When the measurements y are noisy (i.e., y = Θs+z, where z ∈ R m is the additional bounded iid noise, i.e. z 2 ≤ κ), then the following convex quadratic variant of BP called Basis Pursuit Denoising (BPDN) is rather considered:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">R(y, κ) = arg min s s 1 s.t. y -Θs 2 ≤ κ and therefore D(y, n) = Ψ arg min s 1 2 y -Θs 2 2 + λ s 1 ,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">4</ref>) defines our decompression operator and is an instance of convex quadratic programming. In this paper, we use the Orthant-Wise Limited-memory Quasi-Newton (OWL-QN) algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, an extension of Limitedmemory BFGS, which is a numerical scalable optimization procedure that can efficiently solve Eq.

In the case of non-noisy sensing measurements, a BP decoder is more adapted to reconstruct the sparse signal s. Otherwise, BPDN is more suited. This has particular importance in our case when the compressed vector (measurements) are noised to guarantee Differential Privacy, i.e., y = Θs + z where z ∼ N (0, SIσ) (see Section 3.2.2).

The new algoritm is called FL-CS. Moreover, this scheme is also extended to a privacy-preserving version, called FL-CS-DP, which aims to protect the training data of every participant. We show that compression improves model performance with Differential Privacy by reducing the added noise compared to the uncompressed DP variant of federated learning. Hence, both FL-CS and FL-CS-DP improve bandwidth efficiency, and in addition, FL-CS-DP also boosts the accuracy of differentially private federated learning.</p><p>In what follows, we will first describe the non-private scheme FL-CS and then the privacy-preserving FL-CS-DP.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">FL-CS: Federated Learning with Compressive Sensing</head><p>CS assumes the sparsity of the reconstructed signal in a specific basis domain Ψ as explained in Section 2.</p><p>We assume the model update (as a signal) to be already sparse in the time domain, that is, Ψ is canonical sparsity basis (i.e., Ψ = I), and therefore, the compression operator is C(∆w, m) = Φ∆w, where Φ is composed of the first m rows of the matrix of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Indeed, due to the large energy compaction property of DCT, the first coefficients, which correspond to the low frequency components of ∆w, tend to have the largest magnitude and hence convey the most information about the model update <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. In fact, for a canonical sparsity basis Ψ = I, Θ = Φ is RIP with overwhelming probability as soon as m = O(U ln 4 n) if ∆w is U -sparse <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Therefore, reconstruction is possible according to Theorem 1.</p><p>The decompression operator D is defined Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_13">4</ref>).

FL-CS is described in Alg. 3. A client first computes its update ∆w k t with SGD, and then transfers the compressed update C(∆w k t , m), which consists of the first m DCT coefficients of the update (Line 18). The server takes the average of the client's updates (Line 8), updates the momentum (Line 9), and computes the error e t (Line 10-12) due to compression following the error propagation technique described in Section 2.4. This error is accumulated over all federated rounds and added to the model (Line 13) to compensate its negative effect on convergence. The server uses OWL-QN <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> to reconstruct the error-compensated aggregated model update s t ∈ R n . Finally, the server updates the global model as w t = w t-1 + s t before re-distributing the updated model to a new set of clients K.</p><p>Notice that the error e t , the averaged model update y t , as well as the momentum are maintained in the compressed domain and have a size of m instead of n. This is possible due to the linearity of the compression scheme which is detailed in Section 2.3.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Scalable reconstruction:</head><p>Although OWL-QN is reasonably fast in practice, its computational overhead may not be tolerated with very large models. A scalable reconstruction is proposed as follows. On the client side, the update vector ∆w t is shuffled and then splitted into P equally-sized chunks. Then, the compression operator C is applied on each individual chunk. Finally, the compressed chunks are transferred to the server. On the server side, each chunk is reconstructed independently using OWL-QN. The decompressed chunks are concatenated, and the resulted vector with size n is reshuffled to obtain s t by inverting the client-side shuffling.</p><p>Shuffling is performed by each client identically which guarantees that the compressed chunks can still be aggregated by the server. In practice, this can be implemented by sharing a common random seed among all participants to initialize the shuffler. As the server also knows this seed, it can invert this shuffling and reconstruct the aggregated model updates.</p><p>Notice that, instead of reconstructing the complete update vector at once, the server performs reconstruction on smaller chunks which makes decompression faster.</p><p>In addition, shuffling guarantees that the sparsity of the chunks is proportional to the sparsity of the whole update vector (i.e., if the update vector is U -sparse then all its chunks are U/P -sparse). Hence, the same compression operator C(•, m/P ) can be applied on every chunk without increasing the compression ratio (i.e., the compressed update still has a size of m).</p><p>Note that shuffling is also performed identically over all the rounds to maintain the error.</p></div>

We consider an adversary, or a set of colluding adversaries, who can access any update vector sent by the server or any clients at each round of the protocol. A plausible adversary is a participating entity, i.e. a malicious client or server, that wants to infer the training data used by other participants. The adversary is passive (i.e., honest-but-curious), that is, it follows the learning protocol faithfully.</p><p>Different privacy requirements can be considered depending on what information the adversary aims to infer. In general, private information can be inferred about:</p><p>• any record (user) in any dataset of any client (record-level privacy),</p><p>• any client/party (client-level privacy).</p><p>To illustrate the above requirements, suppose that several banks build a common model to predict the creditworthiness of their customers. A bank certainly does not want other banks to learn the financial status of any of their customers (record privacy) and perhaps not even the average income of all their customers (client privacy).</p><p>Record-level privacy is a standard requirement used in the privacy literature and is usually weaker than clientlevel privacy. Indeed, client-level privacy requires to hide any information which is unique to a client including perhaps all its training data.</p><p>We aim at developing a solution that provides clientlevel privacy and is also bandwidth efficient. For example, in the scenario of collaborating banks, we aim at protecting any information that is unique to each single bank's training data. The adversary should not be able to learn from the received model or its updates whether any client's data is involved in the federated run (up to ε and δ). We believe that this adversarial model is reasonable in many practical applications when the confidential information spans over multiple samples in the training data of a single client (e.g., the presence of a group a samples, such as people from a certain race). Differential Privacy guarantees plausible deniability not only to any groups of samples of a client but also to any client in the federated run. Therefore, any negative privacy impact on a party (or its training samples) cannot be attributed to their involvement in the protocol run. </p><formula xml:id="formula_20">z k ∼ G(0, SσI/ √ K) is added to ĉk t such that k∈K (ĉ k t + z k ) = k∈K ĉk</formula><p>t + G(0, SσI) as the sum of Gaussian random variables also follows Gaussian distribution 3 and then differential privacy is satisfied where ε and δ can be computed using the moments accountant described in Section 2.2.</p><p>However, as the noise is inversely proportional to √ K, z k is likely to be small if |K| is too large.

Also, compared to FL-STD, our scheme started to reach the same accuracy from a compression ratio r being equal or greater than 0.1 for both datasets, although the differences between FL-CS and FL-STD for a compression ratio of 0.05 are only of 6% 6 and 1% 7 for the Fashion-Mnist and the medical datasets, respectively. However, FL-STD consumes much more bandwidth than FL-CS. Indeed, FL-CS reduces the bandwidth cost by 95% compared to FL-STD with a compression ratio of 0.05 for both datasets, while the 6. Based on the accuracy 7. Based on the balanced accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> bandwidth cost is reduced to 80% and 85% with a compression ratio of 0.2 for Fashion-MNIST and the medical data, respectively.</p><p>Surprisingly, for the smallest compression ratio 5%, FL-CS-DP performs as well as FL-RND-DP or FL-FREQ in terms of accuracy and much better in terms of bandwidth consumption. Indeed, FL-CS-DP with a compression ratio of 5% reached 0.78 of accuracy on Fashion-MNIST, however, our baseline FL-RND needs a compression ratio of 10% to reach a similar result (0.77) and 20% to have slightly better result (0.80). The same holds for the medical dataset, where FL-CS-DP reached 0.69 and 0.76 of balanced accuracy and Auroc, respectively. However, our other baseline FL-FREQ needs a compression ratio of 20% to reach the same performance. FL-CS-DP performs better for a small compression ratio. Indeed, FL-CS-DP reaches 0.78, 0.73 and 0.66 for 5%, 10% and 20% of accuracy, respectively, on Fashion-MNIST. The accuracy degradation with DP can be explained by the fact increasing the compression ratio r also increases the sensitivity S which has a direct impact on the additive Gaussian noise as explained in Section 3.2.2. Indeed, the standard deviation of the normal distribution is σ × S.</p><p>On both datasets, FL-STD-DP suffers from the noise due to the large sensitivity which is the largest one in Table <ref type="table">5</ref> and 6 for a compression ratio of 1.0 (uncompressed model). Even for FL-RND and FL-FREQ, the gap between the non-private and the private version is larger when the compression ratio increases for both datasets. As the noise proportional to S and is added to every coordinate, the norm of the added noise increases with the model size n. This has negative impact on model convergence for a large n as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. By decreasing n, compression helps reach better utility.</p><p>On Fashion-MNIST, FL-CS-DP with a compression ratio of 0.05 outperforms FL-STD-DP on both utility and bandwidth preservation. However, and even though FL-CS-DP reduces the bandwidth cost by 95% which is not negligible, they have both comparable accuracy on the medical data. It can be explained by the reduction of the noise due to the reduction of S and σ (see Table <ref type="table">6</ref> and Table <ref type="table">5</ref>) needed to reach an value of at most 1 after T cl rounds.</p><p>There is a possible tradeoff between the privacy, communication cost, and utility. Indeed, having a small (better privacy) results in a reduction of the communication costs while it decreases accuracy. FL-STD-DP, for example, converges to the best accuracy (61%) after only 25 rounds with early stopping, which results on high privacy ( =0.69) and low communication cost (only 22.18 Megabyte). However, the accuracy degradation is more important (about 30% which is the worst accuracy degradation indicated in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>). Indeed, the large amount of added noise impacts the convergence of the model which can not achieve an accuracy larger than 61%.</p><p>Finally, we highlight a trade-off for FL-CS-DP. As mentioned above, FL-CS-DP performs better when the smallest compression ratio r is used, as the sensitivity for this level of compression is the smallest one. On the other hand, the compression ratio cannot be decreased arbitrarily as it will result in large reconstruction error. Therefore, one has to find the smallest compression ratio thay is small enough to reduce the perturbation error but large enough to induce small reconstruction error.</p></div>

In <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, the adversary's goal is to infer whether records with a specific property are included in the training dataset of the other participants (called batch property inference). The authors demonstrate the attack by inferring whether black people are included in any of the training datasets, where the common model is trained for gender classification (i.e., the inferred property is independent of the learning objective). The adversary is supposed to have access to the aggregated model update of honest participants. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the proposed attack infers if a specific person is included in the training dataset of the participants (aka, Membership inference). The adversary extracts the following features from every snapshot of the common model, which is a neural network: output value, hidden layers, loss values, and the gradient of the loss with respect to the parameters of each layer. These features are used to train a membership inference model, which is a convolutional neural network.</p><p>The concept of Client-based Differential Privacy has been introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>, where the goal is to hide any information that is specific to a single client's training data. These algorithms bound and noise the contribution of a single client's instead of a single record in the client's dataset. The noise is added by the server, hence, unlike our solution, these works assume that the server is trusted. Also, the noise is drawn from continuous distributions. Bandwidth Optimization in Federated Learning: Different quantization methods have been proposed to save the bandwidth and reduce the communication costs in federated learning. They can be divided into two main groups: unbiased and biased methods. The unbiased approximation techniques use probabilistic quantization schemes to compress the stochastic gradient and attempt to approximate the true gradient value as much as possible <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> [49] [50] <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>. However, biased approximations of the stochastic gradient can still guarantee convergence both in theory and practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>. In signSGD <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, all the clients calculate the stochastic gradient based on a single mini-batch and then send the sign vector of this gradient to the server. The server calculates the aggregated sign vector by taking the median (majority vote) and sends the signs of the aggregated signs back to each client.</p><p>A different line of works exploit the sparsity of model updates to compress model updates. Our work belongs to this line. The authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref> use CS for low-complexity energy-efficient ECG compression. Although compressed sensing was primarily designed for compression <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, it was extended for denoising as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> where compressive sensing is used for the purpose of denoising. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, compressed sensing based denoising and certain artificial intelligence are combined to improve the prediction performance.</p><p>CS was also used with DP in <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. The authors show that the amount of noise is reduced from O( √ n) to O(log(n)), when the noise is added on the sampled coefficients instead of the original database.   Existing works <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> proposed to use a compressive sensing for federated learning in order to compress model updates without privacy guarantees. However, they assume that all clients participate in each round (as they maintain an error accumulation vector at each client due to the compression scheme), but as discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> this assumption is not always realistic. Recently in <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> another compressive sensing algorithm was proposed for federated learning for the denoising purpose (instead of the compression), where the added noise is due to the network transmission.</p><p>Sketching was adapted to federated learning for the purpose of compressing model updates in <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. The authors proposed to use Count-Sketch <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> to retrieve the largest weights in the update vector on the server side. After that, the server uses two additional communication rounds to inform the clients about what gradient values they need to send back to the server. The server then takes the average of the received gradients and zerosout the others before updating the model. The error due to the compression is maintained at each client, and the participation of all clients are required in each round which, as per <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref> and as discussed above, is not practical to federated learning. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, the aforementioned scheme is improved further by directly retrieving the most updated gradient values without asking for their positions in the update vector. This makes the scheme more efficient as it needs fewer communication rounds. Similarly to our approach, the error vector is also maintained on the server side instead of the client side, which is clearly a better fit for federated learning.</p></div>

This is due to the sensitivity reduction which is proportional to the added noise needed to guarantee differential privacy, and to the considered optimization problem (BPDN) which reconstructs data from noisy measurements.</p><p>We believe that the proposed privacy-preserving extension (FL-CS-DP) is an interesting alternative to differentially private federated learning (FL-STD-DP), as it improves both accuracy and bandwidth cost.</p><p>split randomly the dataset into disjoint training and testing data (80% and 20% respectively). The final dataset for testing contains 254,347 patients, with 7,882 deceased patients and 246,465 nondeceased patients (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>). Using Client-Level differential privacy requires to add more noise than Record-Level differential privacy, because the privacy purposes are not the same as detailled in Section 2. To reduce the noise (when is fixed) and then improve the utility, we have to reduce the number of iterations or to reduce the sampling probability which are the parameters used to compute . We therefore have two options to reduce the sampling probability:</p><p>-Reducing the number of clients selected at each round |K|. However this option also decreases the amount of data, and hence have a negative impact on the utility. We therefore preferred to use the next option. -Increasing the total number of clients N :</p><p>we created more hospitals by splitting randomly the training data over 5011 "virtual" hospitals. We also, took care to have at least one in-hospital dead patient per hospital. Each hospital contains 203 patients except one which has 356 patients. We created 5011 hospitals in order to have approximately the same number of patients per hospital, each of them with some inhospital dead patients. In practise, Client-Level differential privacy is more adapted to an environment with a large set of clients as explained in <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2. Imbalanced data</head><p>The dataset of each hospital is imbalanced because the proportion of patients that leave the hospital alive is, fortunately, much larger than in-hospital dead patients. To deal with this well-known problem, we have decided to use downsampling technique <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, a standard solution used for this purpose. 10   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3. Performance Metrics</head><p>We use the following metrics:</p><p>• Balanced accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref> is computed as 1/2 • ( TP P + TN N ) = TPR +TNR 2 and is mainly used with imbalanced data. True Positive Rate (TPR ) and True Negative Rate (TNR ): TPR = TP P and TNR = TN N , where P and N are the number of positive and negative instances, respectively, and TP and TN are the number of true positive and true negative instances. We note that traditional ("non-balanced") accuracy metrics such as TP +TN P +N can be misleading for very imbalanced data <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>: 10. We have also tested weighted loss function and oversampling techniques. But, we noticed experimentally that downsampling technique outperforms the other techniques for all the schemes. in our dataset, the minority class has only 3% of all the training samples (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>), which means that a biased (and totally useless) model always predicting the majority class would have a (nonbalanced) accuracy of 97%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>•</head><p>The area under the ROC curve (AUROC ) is also a frequently used accuracy metric. The ROC curve is calculated by varying the prediction threshold from 1 to 0, when TPR and FPR are calculated at each threshold. The area under this curve is then used to measure the quality of the predictions. A random guess has an AUROC value of 0.5, whereas a perfect prediction has the largest AUROC value of 1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.4. Evaluation Method.</head><p>First, we split randomly the dataset of each hospital into disjoint training and testing data (80% and 20% respectively). An entire federated run is executed with this split, and all the metrics are evaluated in every round on the union of all clients' testing data. All metric values of the round with the best balanced metric are recorded.  </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Algorithm 1 : 2 Initialize common model w0 3 for t = 1 to T cl do 4 Select K clients uniformly at random 5 forj |D j | ∆w k t 9 end Output: Global model wt 10 11</head><label>123145910</label><figDesc>FL-STD: Federated Learning1 Server: each client k in K do 6 ∆w k t = Client k (wt-1) Client k (w k t-1 ):</figDesc></figure>

Preprocessing</head><p>1) Features normalization: we extract from the dataset the values of each feature represented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>. For gender, we use one-hot encoding: Male, Female and Unknown. Similarly, for admission type we use 4 features: Emergency, Urgent, Trauma Center, and Unknown 8 . For drugs, we extract 24,419 features which correspond to the different drugs (name and dosage). A given patient receives only a few of the possible drugs served, resulting in a very sparse patient's record. We use a MinMax normalization for age and MRCI in order to rescale the values of these features between 0 and 1 (using MinMaxScaler class of scikit-learn 9 ). The labels that we consider are boolean: true means that the patient died during his hospital stay while false means she survived. 2) Patients filtering: We consider patient and drug information of the first day at the hospital so that we can make predictions 24 hours after admission (as commonly found in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>). We filter out the pregnant and new-born patients because the medication types and admission services are not the same for theses two categories of patients. Our model prediction is built without patients' historical medical data. This has the advantage to require minimum patient's information and to work for new patients. 3) Hospitals filtering: The dataset contains 415 hospitals for a total size of 1,271,733 records.
