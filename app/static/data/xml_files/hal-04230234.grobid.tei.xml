<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Integrating and interpreting meteorological data requires metadata about the features of interest (e.g. the air), their observed properties(e.g. air temperature or humidity), the specific location of a weather station, the time (instant or interval) at or during which the parameter was measured, and a variety of other information. In our previous works, we proposed a model for meteorological data and we built the WeKG-MF knowledge graph of observational weather data from historical archives of synoptic stations located in France and its overseas territories <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. It is compliant with linked open data best practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and accessible through a SPARQL endpoint <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . Since then, we enriched WeKG-MF with basic aggregate values of weather parameters (e.g., daily min/max temperatures), not initially included in Météo-France weather reports, based on official documentation published by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and Météo-France. These aggregate values were semantically described and integrated as part of the WeKG-MF graph to serve different needs and studies. In specific domains such as agriculture, experts are interested in established and significant parameters such as the total monthly amount of precipitation, the number of days where the amount of precipitation is higher than a threshold over a given period, or the monthly average of daily maximum and minimum temperatures, and others. These agrometeorological parameters play a crucial role in determining crop growth, development and yield and are essential for agricultural planning, management and decision-making.</p><p>In this paper, we present our work to formalize and implement a set of SPARQL queries to compute agro-meteorological parameters based on WeKG-MF, and to deploy a LOD platform allowing users to navigate, consume, visualize and produce linked datasets of agrometerological parameters calculated on-the-fly on WeKG-MF. We also provide an updated presentation of WeKG-MF and its data model. Section 2 provides an overview of WeKG-MF and highlights its design principles. Section 3, shows how WeKG-MF enables the calculation of relevant agro-meteorological parameters based on a set of SPARQL queries. Section 4 describes the LOD platform that enables users to calculate and visualize on-the-fly different agro-meteorological parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">WEKG-MF OBSERVATIONAL WEATHER KNOWLEDGE GRAPH</head><p>In this section we summarize the description of WeKG core model for linked weather data presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, focusing here on its enrichment to represent aggregate meteorological features based on spatio-temporal slices of observations and we present the last version of the WeKG-MF knowledge graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">WeKG Semantic Model</head><p>The WeKG model re-uses and extends domain ontologies, among which the Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> ontologies for sensors and observations, the GeoSPARQL ontology for spatial features and their relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the Time ontology <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> for temporal entities, and the RDF Data Cube ontology <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for aggregation and multidimensionality features. The WeKG model addresses the semantic modelling issues related to meteorological observations and provides a generic model that can be adopted by weather data providers to publish their dataset as linked data. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">WeKG-MF Knowledge Graph</head><p>WeKG-MF is a FAIR knowledge graph compliant with the WeKG semantic model and built from open weather data published by Météo-France. It now includes 10 years (2012-2022) of historical weather observations, initially downloadable as CSV files <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">4</ref> . The RDF files are loaded into a Docker-based Virtuoso OS server. The WeKG-MF generation pipeline is reproducible and the mapping rules can be customized to meet the needs of other weather data providers. A documentation is available on our Github repository <ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">5</ref> .</p><p>WeKG-MF allows users to query atomic weather observations as well as aggregate values pre-calculated and stored in RDF Data Cubes. Atomic observations and pre-calculated RDF slices are loaded in different named graphs. An example SPARQL query retrieving daily average temperatures in the french region 'Nouvelle Acquitaine' during 2021 is presented in listing 1. An additional RDF Turtle file describes the WeKG-MF graph using the DCAT<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">6</ref> , VOID <ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">7</ref>and SPARQL-SD <ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">8</ref>  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">COMPUTATION OF AGRO-METEOROLOGICAL PARAMETERS</head><p>The WeKG-MF graph is intended to serve different use case scenarios in several domains, including agriculture, biodiversity and climate studies. In the context of the D2KAB French project <ref type="foot" target="#foot_6">9</ref> , we identified several competency questions (CQ) that reflect the needs of experts to understand and compare weather conditions across years and to study their potential impact on crop growth and plant disease advent and management. These CQ have guided us to identify a set of agro-meteorological parameters that can be computed on WeKG-MF. The first step towards the computation of agro-meteorological parameters is to pre-calculate and store aggregate values as RDF data cubes. We adopted a strategy which consists in combining several SPARQL CONSTRUCT queries, whose results sets are integrated into the spatio-temporal slice of daily maximum, minimum and mean air temperatures as well as daily total precipitation. Note that the WMO documentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> indicates methods to calculate daily total rainfall for the day 𝑅 𝑑 as the accumulated amount of precipitation recorded at a specific day 𝑑 from 6 : 00 UTC till 6 : 00 UTC of the following day 𝑑+1. The same time interval is considered to calculate the maximum daily air temperatures 𝑇𝑚𝑎𝑥 𝑑 whereas minimum daily temperature 𝑇𝑚𝑖𝑛 𝑑 are calculated over the time interval spanning from 18 : 00 UTC the previous day 𝑑 -1 till 18 : 00 UTC of the day 𝑑.</p><p>We implemented these calculation methods in SPARQL and stored query results as part of the WeKG-MF graph. This allowed us to find a balance between calculating on-the-fly agro-meteorological parameters and pre-calculating and storing significant SPARQL queries results in order to manage the workload of the WeKG-MF SPARQL endpoint.</p><p>As an example, Listing 2 illustrates the SPARQL query to calculate 𝐺𝐷𝐷, 𝐺𝑆𝑇 𝑎𝑣𝑔 and total rainfall recorded in French weather stations (in the Northern hemisphere, lat≥0) during 2021. All of these agro-meteorological parameters are calculated for the viticulture's growing season and 𝐺𝐷𝐷 are calculated based on the 10°C base temperature. A benchmark of 20 SPARQL queries serving as examples to illustrate how WeKG-MF can be queried is available <ref type="foot" target="#foot_7">10</ref> .  In the current version of our Web application, we defined and implemented 14 different agro-meteorological in SPARQL. As the user selects parameters, different visualisations are proposed (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1b</ref>). We provide different kinds of visualisations. A first visualisation shows different line charts, where the x-axis represents time, the y-axis represents the temperatures and the plots are the timeseries of daily min/max/avg temperatures. If the user selects daily total precipitation, the previously chart is updated automatically. This visualisation allows users to study daily temperatures and rainfall during the growing season period (top chart in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>). It is automatically updated if the user selects another time period.A second visualisation allows users to compare accumulated GDD and rainfall (bottom chart in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1c</ref>).</p></div>

Use cases in the agronomy and agriculture domains are identified for which WeKG-MF will be integrated with other knowledge sources in order to meet expert requirements.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: WeKG-MF-based Web application for computing and visualizing agro-meteorological parameters</figDesc><graphic coords="5,53.80,175.54,151.32,99.21" type="bitmap" /></figure>

These parameters include various indicators such as extreme monthly temperatures, Growing Degree Days (𝐺𝐷𝐷), cumulative weekly/monthly 𝐺𝐷𝐷, minimum, maximum and average Growing Season Temperatures (𝐺𝑆𝑇 𝑚𝑖𝑛 , 𝐺𝑆𝑇 𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝐺𝑆𝑇 𝑎𝑣𝑔 ), cumulative (weekly/monthly) rainfall, the number of frost/summer/wet/windy days, average soil temperatures. All of these parameters are calculated over the growing season period which vary from one crop to another. Temperatures and precipitations are both key factors in the viability and growth of crops as well as the yield quantity and quality. For instance, during the growing season, it is important for experts to assess the heat accumulation based on the 𝐺𝑆𝑇 and 𝐺𝐷𝐷 parameters. For most plants, phenological development stages from seeding to maturity is related to the accumulation of heat or temperature units above a threshold or base temperature below which no growth occurs. For instance, in viticulture, during the growing season that ranges from April to October (Northern Hemisphere), 𝐺𝐷𝐷 and 𝐺𝑆𝑇 are calculated according to the base temperature of 10°C. Furthermore, frost events caused by extreme</figDesc><table><row><cell>Although</cell></row><row><cell>SOSA/SSN ontologies are commonly used to represent knowledge</cell></row><row><cell>about sensor data across domains, the definition of observable</cell></row><row><cell>properties and features of interest, as well as their alignment with</cell></row><row><cell>existing controlled vocabularies, are delegated to the community</cell></row><row><cell>of interest.

In this respect, OWL temporal classes are defined and reused to describe the measurement period of time of meteorological observations related to specific observable properties. For instance, observations related to rainfall indicate precipitations amounts recorded during the last 3, 6, 9, 12 or 24 hours of a specific synoptic hour</p>2 </p>. In WeKG model, depending on the observable property, it is possible to describe the temporal aspects of a meteorological observation using different temporal entities either to represent the specific synoptic hour of a result or the duration of measurement interval. At least one temporal entity is attached to each fine-grained atomic observation. Observations produced by sensors can rapidly reach enormous volumes. Aggregating them to create suitable meteorological indicators is a recurrent need in different domains. In this respect, we reuse the RDF Data Cube Vocabulary (DCV)</p><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> </p>to describe multi-dimensional data structures. In our model, we define spatio-temporal slices of observations by fixing the spatial and temporal dimensions: the spatial dimension refers to the weather station, while the temporal dimension corresponds to a calendar interval. An observation (instance of qb:Observation) in a spatio-temporal slice is represented by a set of measures (instances of qb:MeasureProperty) each linked to an observable property with property qb:concept.</p>2 </p>Main synoptic hours are 00, 06, 12, 18 UTC. Intermediate synoptic hours are 03, 09, 15, 21 UTC 3 https://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-specified-values/ 2.2 minimum temperatures can cause damage to emerging buds and shoots, especially if they occur during the first two months of the growing season. Also, high rainfall during June can have a negative impact on grapevine flowering and subsequent grape yield. While all of the previous assumptions are made for viticulture, changing to another crop such as wheat implies the same calculation methods even if thresholds may vary depending on the development stages defined for a certain crop. We extended the WeKG thesaurus of meteorological observable properties and features of interest to include new SKOS concepts that represent the agro-meteorological parameters. They are formally defined, documented and related to previously defined concepts.</p></note></figure>
