<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Information of the geographical and spatial type is found in numerous text documents and constitutes a very challenging target for extraction. Geoparsing applications have been developed to extract geographic terms. However, off-the-shelf Named Entity Recognition (NER) models are mainly designed for Toponym recognition and are very sensitive to language specificity. In this paper, we propose a workflow to first extract geographic and spatial entities based on a BiLSTM-CRF architecture with a concatenation of several text representations. We also propose a Relation Extraction module, particularly aimed at spatial relationships extraction, to build a structured Geospatial knowledge base. We demonstrate our pipeline by applying it to the case of French housing advertisements, which generally provide information about a property's location and neighbourhood. Our results show that the workflow tackles French language and the variability and irregularity of housing advertisements, generalizes Geoparsing to all geographic and spatial terms, and successfully retrieves most of the relationships between entities from the text.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>natural disasters). To capture and extract spatial information from text, Geoparsing applications have been widely developed and are mainly focused on Place-name or Toponym extraction. Indeed, names are often used by people to refer to places and they can be linked to existing Digital Gazetteers. However, Gazetteers mostly record official Place names, whereas text documents may contain non-official, local Place names. Also, spatial descriptions might use geographic entities (i.e., features like station, beach, city center, . . . ) to mention places. For example, in housing advertisements, geographic entities give more information about a neighbourhood and its facilities.</p><p>Another challenge of extracting spatial information is to create a structured knowledge base. Relationships, and more particularly spatial relationships, between extracted entities provide a structured representation of Geospatial information.</p><p>Applications and studies from various domains (geography, urban planning, real estate intelligence, . . . ) could result from the extracted knowledge. For example, spatial information could help to locate an entity-and, in particular, a property-since real estate advertisers do not always provide the exact location. Spatial and urban analyses may also be carried out about perception of residential spaces, valuable neighborhood factors or influential zone of a toponym.</p><p>In this work, we propose an automatic workflow for extracting Geospatial knowledge from text written in French. The workflow is divided in two main stages. First, we extend Named Entity Recognition to Spatial entities designed for French housing advertisements. Then, we develop a Relationship Extraction model to locate Spatial entities. The contributions of this paper may be summarized as follows:</p><p>• We define new Spatial entity categories to describe locations.</p><p>• We propose a Named Entity Recognition model to extract Toponyms and our new Spatial entities from French housing advertisements. • We develop a Relationship Extraction model to create a structured Geospatial knowledge base.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work on Geographic Named Entity Recognition and Relationship Extraction; Section 3 presents the methodological details of our automatic workflow for extracting Geospatial Knowledge; Section 4 presents and discusses the results of experiments based on French housing advertisements dataset; Finally, Section 5 draws some conclusions and outlines directions for further research.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Geographic Named Entity Recognition</head><p>Geoparsing is the task to detect geographic terms from text and has been widely used in various types of texts such as travel blogs <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, social media in emergencies <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>, housing advertisements <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, or fictional novels <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. This method is often a subtask of Named Entity Recognition (NER) applied to geographic entities. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref>, the authors reviewed traditional to state-of-the-art NER approaches. The traditional approach is based on linguistic rules and Knowledge systems and often uses Gazetteers. This approach is frequently used for Geoparsing <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> but gives limited results and depends on the completeness of the rules and Gazetteers. In recent years, deep neural network models have been developed and achieved very good results on NER taks and particularly for Toponym Recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29]</ref>.</p><p>Most of the above-mentioned works only detect Toponyms in the English language. However, our research focused on all geographical and spatial terms in the French language, for which limited linguistic resources are available. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, the authors have defined and extracted French Spatial Nominal Entities that refer to physical objects in a spatial context (i.e., a geographic term that is not linked to a Toponym), which is similar to our proposal. Regarding the French language, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> compared different deep neural network models to retrieve Named Entities applied to French Legal texts. They demonstrated that BiLSTM-CRF combined with text representations gives the best results for this task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Relationship Extraction</head><p>Relationship extraction (RE) aims at extracting semantic relationships from a text, usually between two or more entities of a certain type. A large number of works use features of dependency-parsed sentences as extraction patterns or Machine Learning input <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>. Several methods have been developed from Dependency Graph such as shortest path dependency or frequent sub-graph. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, the authors have proven that the shortest path dependency kernel is very efficient in extracting binary relationships. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> has extended this method to 𝑛-ary relationships. Another approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> is to find frequent sub-graph from the Dependency Graph to discover patterns. In a recent work <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, a Dependency Graph has also been used in a neural network. The idea is to embed several adjacency matrices to get a better dependency representation. Thus, a Graph Convolutional Network is applied to the Dependency Graph and then the new embedding feeds a classification model. The use of deep Learning methods is more and more frequent in the field of RE, as summarized in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, and achieves state-of-the-art results. Nevertheless, neural networks need huge annotated corpora for training, and might not be effective for relationships occurring in just a few examples.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">METHODOLOGY 3.1 Overview</head><p>In this paper, we propose a two-stage method to automatically retrieve spatial information in housing advertisements, mostly located in the French Riviera, and extract relationships to create a structured knowledge base.</p><p>The two main stages of the proposed method are:</p><p>• Perform Spatial Named Entity Recognition;</p><p>• Retrieve relationships between Spatial entities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Spatial Information in Housing Advertisements</head><p>Housing advertisements have several advantages to extract spatial information as they generally provide information about a property's environment and location. Indeed, location is one of the most important factors in purchasing decisions. Thus, advertisers give a description of the neighbourhood and its facilities to promote the location to a future resident. Also, housing advertisements are a fairly exhaustive and updated source of data since many geographic areas are found and they are posted recurrently. Finally, advertisers often provide an online version that facilitates data collection (e.g., by crawling housing websites). Thus, before retrieving information, we identified 4 spatial entity categories in housing advertisements that describe the neighbourhood of a property and spatial relationships:</p><p>• Geographic entity: entity representing natural features, constructions and subdivisions of land which is located on or near the surface of the earth. • Toponym: entity referring to proper names of places (also known as place name or geographic name) • Spatio-Temporal entity: entity localizing geographic entity or Toponym • Mode of transportation: entity describing the travel mode between two places The first two categories, Toponym and geographic entity, explicitly define the environment at different levels. Entity can refer to places in the residential area of a property, its neighbourhood or even the city. Toponym, or place name, is the most classic way to characterize a place and is found in many Named Entity Recognition frameworks. Also, Gazetteers, such as GeoNames, already record millions of place names around the world. On the other hand, a geographic entity also describes a place but is frequently associated with a Toponym (e.g., University of Nice, Nice-Riquier station, Masséna square, etc.). Thus, even if geographic entities are often mentioned in the literature, this category is never extracted. However, a geographic entity itself still gives information about a neighbourhood and its facilities. For example, we can extract the number of schools in an area or the proximity with public transport. Also, we can infer the exact place by cross-analysis with other databases and the spatial context.</p><p>After referencing places with Toponyms and geographic entities, we want to locate them to better understand their spatial context. Spatial relationships play a key role to link all those entities and a property in the space. However, a spatial relationship might be expressed in different ways (e.g., temporal or kilometer distance). Thus, we propose to create a Spatio-Temporal entity, which describes the spatial relationship between two places or a place and a property. It can be an exact or vague distance (e.g., near, 10 kilometers away, 5 minutes, etc.). Lastly, the Mode of transportation entity specifies the Spatio-Temporal entity (e.g., 5 minutes walking is different from 5 minutes driving) and can reduce its vagueness.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows several examples of those 4 types of entities.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Named Entity Recognition</head><p>The first stage of our pipeline is the Named Entity Recognition module, which extracts all the entities mentioned above. The proposed model is based on a BiLSTM+CRF architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, which has achieved very good results on NER tasks. We also added an embedding to the BiLSTM+CRF, which is a global vector composed of the concatenation of three different text representations, to capture features at different levels (see Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>).</p><p>The first text representation is a basic Word Embedding architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> that we trained on our corpus of French housing advertisements. Secondly, we fine-tuned the two pre-trained French Flair Language Models <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> with our corpus, which corresponds to a BiLSTM Language Model. This Language Model has a contextbased and character-level representation that is well-suited for complex tasks. Also, the specificity of only keeping the first and last state helps handle out-of-vocabulary words and small dictionaries. Finally, its French pre-trained model is a good advantage for our task since few models are available for French. Finally, we applied CamemBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, a French Transformer Language Model. Transformers are faster and more efficient than BiLSTM or CNN architectures, since they use parallel attention layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Moreover, Transformer Language Models are trained on huge corpora with two specific tasks: masked language model (MLM) and next sentence prediction (NSP). For MLM, some tokens are masked and the model has to predict them in a sentence. The other task (NSP) aims at predicting, of two sentences, which one follows the other. While those models reach high performance, some limitations have arisen: the need of a huge training set on the one hand and limitation of their application to specific domains or tasks due to pre-trained models on general domain on the other hand. Nevertheless, we decided not to fine-tune the French pre-trained model, CamemBERT, due to a lack of a huge training corpus.</p><p>Housing advertisements have language and stylistic specificity and variability, and an informal format that are captured with the above three text representations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Relationship Extraction</head><p>The previous stage identifies spatial entities thanks to a NER model. However, information is totally unstructured, whereas there exist relationships between entities in the text. The last part of our method tries to reconstruct relationships between spatial entities and provide a structured representation of extracted information.</p><p>We determined four types of relationships to get a structured knowledge base:</p><p>• Attributes: attributes of spatial entities such as adjectives, numerical, noun object (e.g., 5 minutes, residential neighbourhood, etc.); • Geographic Composition: affiliation link between geographic entity and/or Toponym (e.g., Nice City Center, City of Cannes, Audiberti High School, etc.); • Spatial: relationship between Spatio-Temporal entity and geographic entity, Toponym or the property itself; • Mode of transportation: relationship between Spatio-Temporal entity and Mode of transportation.</p><p>We made several assumptions to perform the relation extraction.</p><p>The first is that a relationship occurs only between two entities of the same sentence. Then, we assumed that a direct or indirect connection between the two entities always exists in the sentence, which can be captured by a dependency graph. Our last assumption is that words between the two entities also play an important role. Thus, we highlighted two types of features to recognize the relationships:</p><p>• Shortest path dependency between entities; • Sub-phrase between entities.</p><p>3.4.1 Shortest-Path Dependency. In a sentence, the syntactical structure based on grammar gives relationships between words as a tree. Two methods are frequently used: Constituency and Dependency parsing. On the one hand, Constituency parsing uses the formalism of context-free grammars and the sentence is divided in sub-phrases that belong to the same grammatical category. On the other hand, Dependency parsing directly assigns grammatical connections between words. A relation is binary and consists of a head word, a dependent word and a grammatical function. This approach is more suitable for analysing housing advertisements, since the order of words does not always follow classical grammar (e.g., housing advertisements do not always contain a verb or a subject). Also, the head-dependent relation offers a good approximation of predicate-argument relation for Information Extraction. Finally, the Universal Dependencies taxonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> is general enough to easily capture dependencies in housing advertisements and can be adapted to another language. As we did not have a labeled corpus available, we performed dependency parsing using Stanza <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> for French, which is based on the Universal Dependencies taxonomy and is already trained on a large corpus. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>: Features of candidate relationships</head><p>However, this model was not very accurate, especially with the Part-of-Speech tagging module. Thus, we trained a Part-of-Speech tagger by first predicting labels with an existing tagger and then correcting predictions to get a labeled data set.</p><p>After carrying out dependency parsing, we got a dependency graph of each sentence and extracted the shortest directed path for each candidate relationship. The path is composed of nodes that represent entities or Part-of-Speech tags and edges corresponding to grammatical relations.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows Spatial Named entities, Part-of-Speech tags and Dependency parsing in a sentence. Two type of relationships occur in this example: spatial and geographic composition. To find a spatial relationship, the shortest-path dependency is extracted between a Toponym or Geographic entity and a Spatio-Temporal entity. For geographic composition relationship, the aim is to find a path between two Geographic entities, two Toponyms or a Geographic entity and a Toponym. All the candidate relationships and their shortest-path dependencies are summarized in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.2">Classification.</head><p>After extracting all the candidate relationships thanks to the shortest path, we built four classification models, one for each type of relation. Those models take as input the subphrase between two entities and their shortest-path dependency. We transformed both inputs into vectors with an embedding model. For the sub-phrase, we used the same embedding as for the Named Entity Recognition task.</p><p>Regarding the shortest-path dependency, we chose to model the path as a sequence of entities (Named Entities or Part-of-Speech tags) and grammatical relations. Thus, we embedded each sequence based on the Sqn2Vec method <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. This method is unsupervised and designed for small-vocabulary sequential datasets. It combines two techniques: Sequential Pattern Mining and Neural Embedding Learning. The idea is to first extract all the Sequential Patterns from the dataset and then to learn an embedding for each sequence. The embedding is a concatenation of two representations. The former is only based on predicting which single symbols are in the sequence while the latter predicts to which Sequential Pattern the sequence belongs to. Both predictions are based on a Paragraph Vector-Distributed Bag-of-Words <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p><p>We could have used a graph embedding model <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, since dependency relationships are represented as a graph. Graph embedding is often based on the adjacency matrix, which embeds either nodes or edges. However, we noticed that the entities (i.e., nodes) and the grammatical relations (i.e., edges) are both important in the shortest-path dependency. Thus, we needed an embedding that takes both into account.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.3">Output.</head><p>The final step is focused on the representation of the extracted relationships in a structured knowledge base. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ref> shows a graph representation of the previous example. Nodes represent Spatial entities and edges the type of relationship. Regarding spatial relationships, Spatio-Temporal entities (at the heart and close to) should describe the relationship between two places or a place and a property. Thus, spatial relationship can be viewed as a ternary relationship with a place or a property as subject and/or object, and a Spatio-Temporal entity as attribute of the predicate. In this example, the subject is missing, as we have only detected a link between a Spatio-Temporal entity and one geographic entity.</p><p>If (and only if) the subject is missing, we always assume that the property being advertised is the subject.</p><p>Finally, a post-processing step should be applied to get ternary and binary relationships in order to create a Geospatial Knowledge Graph, whose description is out of the scope of this work. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS</head><p>In this section, we apply the proposed two-stage workflow to a dataset of French housing advertisements in the French Riviera. We first describe the dataset and then present the results and the performance of the workflow.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Dataset</head><p>As a standard French dataset is not available to train and evaluate our method, we collected about 1,200 housing advertisements <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>written in French gathered from various online advertisers on the French Riviera. The average length of the ads is about 650 words after a preprocessing stage. Cleaning the text was necessary since the French house ads were full of noisy, repetitive words and abbreviations. We also removed new lines, URLs, special symbols and characters (e.g., &amp;, #, *) using regular expressions. Then, we manually annotated the dataset following the BIESO tagging scheme. Finally, we split the dataset into 10 folds and evaluated our pipeline through cross-validation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Performance Evaluation</head><p>In this subsection, we evaluate the performance of the two stages of our workflow. We start by comparing several architectures for Named Entity Recognition, trained on our annotated spatial entities. We chose the Spacy and Bi-LSTM-CRF architectures as they do not use the same type of neural networks (CNN and RNN respectively). We could not compare them with off-the-shelf models, as they do not extract the same Named Entities. Regarding Spacy, we fine-tuned a pre-trained model for French with our entities and trained another from scratch. For the second architecture, we tried different embeddings and combinations to handle French and the language specificity of housing advertisements. We fine-tuned the Flair embedding and trained a Word2Vec model. </p></div>

Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref> shows the models that have weak or no evidence of a significantly different F1-Score.</p><p>First, we notice that BiLSTM+CRF architecture mostly outperforms Spacy architectures except with Word2Vec embedding at a 1% significance level. Spacy architecture gets slightly better results with a model trained from scratch. Regarding BiLSTM+CRF models with a single embedding, CamemBERT achieves very good performance. Flair gets a similar Recall to CamemBERT but the Precision is lower. We can underline that the combination of Flair and CamemBERT increases the performance of the 3 metrics. The combination of Flair and Word2Vec or CamemBERT and Word2Vec increases the Precision but decreases the Recall. Moreover, there is no evidence of statistically significant differences between those models. Finally, the combination of the three representation (Flair + CamemBERT + Word2Vec) achieves the best results while the Welch's t-test does not show difference with Flair + CamemBERT. Nevertheless, we chose to keep this model for our application.  The second evaluation consists of estimating the performance of each relationship classification. We created four datasets with candidates for each type of relationships and tagged them with a binary label. We tried different classification models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine or XGBoost, and quantified their performance with Accuracy defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">Accuracy = #(𝐿𝑎𝑏𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑑 ∩ 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑔𝑛𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑) #𝐿𝑎𝑏𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑑 .<label>(5)</label></formula><p>In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>, we present the best performance of each classification using an XGBoost model. All classifications get an accuracy above 95% and even 97% for three of them. However, those results might be biased because of the small dataset for some relationships and imbalanced classes. Especially, Mode of Transportation relationship has been evaluated on a very small dataset (216 rows) and totally imbalanced classes (209 label 1 and 7 label 0). The other three relationships are more accurate since their dataset contains more than All in all, our proposed workflow performs well to retrieve Spatial entities and relationships. Nevertheless, we separately evaluated each model which does not represent the global performance of the pipeline. Indeed, the Relationship Extraction stage depends on the good results of Named Entity Recognition model. Thus, the error is propagated across the model and should be quantified with a fully annotated dataset with both Spatial entities and relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In this paper, we have proposed a two-stage method to automatically retrieve Geospatial information from housing advertisements. A major contribution is the recognition of Geographic and Spatio-Temporal entity to better understand the spatial context. Also, the Named Entity Recognition model is fine-grained to discover new Toponyms that would have not been found with off-the-shelf NER models. Another contribution is the Relationship Extraction tool and in particular the Spatial relationship. We have proposed to build binary relationship between Spatio-Temporal entities and Toponyms, Geographic entities or the property to easily capture a ternary Spatial relationship in a post-processing part. Finally, our method is designed for French language and housing advertisements but can be adapted to other languages and types of text by annotating a corpus, changing the embedding and retraining the model. In addition, some domain-and task-specific heuristics, such as assuming that an implicit subject is the property being advertised, would have to be dispensed with or replaced when adapting our method to other tasks or domains.</p><p>Several directions could be considered to expand this work. First, Entity Recognition is only the first step of Information Extraction, and adding Entity Resolution would help to reduce ambiguity of Toponym and Geographic entity. A number of Toponym Resolution models already exist but may not be efficient for Geographic entity. Also, it would be interesting to link Toponym and Geographic entities to existing Knowledge bases (e.g GeoNames, DBpedia, Wikidata). Second, we have extracted Spatio-Temporal entities in order to build Spatial relationships; however the Real Estate market often exaggerates proximity-related terms and introduces uncertainty and vagueness in their advertisements <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. A promising work would be to qualify and quantify the uncertainty and vagueness of those terms to improve the reliability of the location of the mentioned places. Third, the extracted information combined with their socio-spatial context may be analysed and studied within urban space researches (e.g., perception of residential spaces, elements of a neighbourhood, valuable neighborhood factor).</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :Figure 2 :</head><label>12</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Overall NER architecture</figDesc><graphic coords="5,53.80,314.73,504.41,99.95" type="bitmap" /></figure>
