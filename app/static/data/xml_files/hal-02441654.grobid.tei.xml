<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Generally, computing systems are understood as being purposeful processing units, directed to produce expected results by means of computational resources manipulating data through controlled computational environments.</p><p>At the infrastructure level, some hardware and software mechanisms ensure correct operation of the computing resources (e.g. power-on self-test, etc.), integrity and persistence of the data (e.g. Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), memory content refresh, etc.). At the system level, accesses to the computational resources are made safe by an operating system or a middleware. The computational environments being controlled, the production and the persistence of the expected results are guaranteed "by design" solely provided that the computer What trust can we have that the temperature in the living room is going to be changed to 23 ℃? In other words, can one consider the above code snippet as a perfect deterministic model of the physical system? Considering that the living room is a non-isolated physical system, the answer is "no". Such systems are driven by non-deterministic dynamics, at any time, the temperature of the living room can be affected by surrounding processes over which the computing system has no control <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>  <ref type="bibr">[3] [4]</ref>. This situation is aggravated for the Internet of Things (IoT)-based CPS whose underlying infrastructure is volatile. Indeed, their structural components being embedded into physical things, their availability cannot be ensured over time. Consequently, the attainment of the CPS purposes cannot be guaranteed solely "by design" <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p><p>As a solution to this problem, we propose to quantitatively assess, at run-time, to which extent the CPS purposes are met. In other words, it is about providing the degree of effectiveness of the CPS as a measure of the concrete evolution of the physical system according to the expected evolution. To be more precise about the measure and the meaning we seek to give it as an assessment of the degree of effectiveness of the CPS, we borrow some terminology employed in the viability theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. Let us assume that the expected evolution of the physical system can be specified as a deterministic model, free from uncertainties, where (1) state transitions are determined by contextual events (stimuli), <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> states are qualified by the expected physical effects resulting from actuators over which the computing system has control. Zones of Viability extend this deterministic point of view with tolerances accounting for aleatory uncertainties pertaining the natural variability of actuators effects and sensors readings and for epistemic uncertainties relative to the users' satisfaction towards the concrete evolution of the physical system. In this paper, we propose to generalize the deterministic model in the framework of the measure theory. Doing so, one can leverage the set of measures (probabilities, possibilities, etc.) as a means of defining zones of viability from which one can reason in order to obtain the degree of effectiveness. By obtaining a quantitative measure of the degree of effectiveness, (1) one can leverage this measure within a feedback loop so as for the controller of the system to minimize the behavioral drift (e.g. negative feedback control systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>), <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> one can use this measure as a bench-marking tool used to compare algorithms deployed for controlling CPS.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related work and contributions</head><p>The work presented in this paper is closely related to the dependability of the computing systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Within computer science, this term refers to the trust that can justifiably be placed in the service delivered by computing systems and covers all their critical quality aspects <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>In other words, it reflects users' degree of trust in these systems. Among the attributes of dependability <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, availability (i.e. readiness for correct service), reliability (i.e. continuity of correct service), safety (i.e. absence of consequences on the users and the environment) and integrity (i.e. absence of improper system alterations) characterize the immunity of computing systems towards uncontrolled physical processes and associated uncertainties (i.e. threats that can affect computing systems operation and undermine their dependability <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>). The assessment of the dependability can be done at design time through analytic metrics using models of the systems and, whenever possible, the known uncertainties (e.g. U-Test <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>). Run-time monitoring involves direct and indirect empirical metrics, respectively measuring the system itself through probes (whenever possible) and its effects within the physical environment through sensors.</p><p>While methodologies involved at design time (e.g. Model-based design) and at testing phase (e.g. Model checking, simulation, etc.) are respectively devoted to fault prevention and fault removal, run-time monitoring is devoted to automatic fault and anomaly detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. The most common formulation of the anomaly detection problem is to determine if a given test sequence is anomalous with respect to normal sequences. More formally, given a set of n normal sequences S = {(S k ) 1,k∈N , . . . , (S k ) n,k∈N } and a test sequence (S k ) k∈N , it is about computing an anomaly score for (S k ) k∈N , with respect to S. It is assumed that test sequences might be misaligned in time and space w.r.t the normal sequences. We do also consider complex, and collective anomalies. On the one hand, when contextual attributes can be associated with observations (e.g. time, location, etc.), contextual anomalies are corresponding to behaviors that are valid under some conditions but are abnormal in others. For instance, in European countries, normally high temperatures during the summer can be considered as contextual anomalies if they occur during the winter (time-based contextual anomaly). On the other hand, collective anomalies correspond to a collection of consecutive behaviors which are not abnormal by themselves but are abnormal when they occur together as a collection <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Approaches that address these anomalies fall into three categories described hereafter.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Prediction-based approaches</head><p>These approaches consist in modeling legitimate behavior through a parametric model learned from observations and further used for predicting observation at each time t. Abnormal behaviors are those whose real observations differ from the predicted ones.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, authors use stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> for anomaly/fault detection in time series. A network is trained on non-anomalous data and used as a predictor over a number of time steps. The resulting prediction errors are modeled as a multivariate Gaussian distribution, which is used to assess the likelihood of anomalous behavior. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, authors present an unsupervised approach to detect cyber-attacks in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). A Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is used as a time series predictor. The Cumulative Sum method is further used to identify anomalies in a replicate of a water treatment plant.</p><p>pros &amp; cons: these models are difficult to train <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and are generally hardly interpretable, their intrinsic structure and parameters making unclear the mapping between the variables and the observations <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. For instance, such models, once learned make difficult, if not impossible, the modification of their intrinsic parameters in order to tune a posteriori the tolerances pertaining the epistemic uncertainties. More importantly, learning a comprehensive model of the CPS behavior based on observations is often impracticable with regards to their complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Model drift-based approaches</head><p>These approaches are relative to the anomalous evolution of the model parameters. The basic idea is to build a parametric behavioral test model from test sequences as they arrive and compare it with the normal behavioral model. Dissimilarities between models give the anomaly score.</p><p>Authors in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> focus on the quantitative measure of concept drift and introduce the notion of drift magnitude whose value can be quantified through distance functions such as Kullback-Leibler Divergence or Hellinger Distance. Close to the idea of concept drift is the notion of Bayesian Surprise <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. A surprise quantifies how data affects an observer. It quantifies a mismatch between an expectation and what is actually observed by measuring the difference between posterior and prior beliefs of the observer. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> authors propose using Bayesian surprise as a measure of the learning progress of reinforcement learning agents.</p><p>pros &amp; cons: being based on the distance between prior and posterior beliefs, the main disadvantage of these approaches concerns the speed of convergence to an accurate test model, highly dependent on the number of observations needed to learn it. Hereby, a short time anomalous behavior might be "attenuated" or even not detected. These approaches are mainly leveraged in autonomic computing and the models@run-time community <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> where an initial model is updated over time taking into account unanticipated evolutions of the environment. In this context, above a given threshold, the quantitative drift value is used to trigger the update of the model with the newly learned parameters, assuming it represents the correct behavior.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Likelihood-based approaches</head><p>These approaches consist in modeling legitimate behavior through a parametric model and considering abnormal behaviors as those having low "likelihood" to have been generated by the model.</p><p>In this category, Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) and derivatives (n-order Markov chains) are widely used where tolerances towards uncertainties are generally described through probability density functions (pdf). An extension of the Markovian models, denoted by Hidden Markov Models (HMM), consists in considering the case where states of the model are "hidden" <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, i.e. not directly observable, or partially hidden <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Such models are particularly well suited in the context of this paper where it is assumed that while the expected behavior of a CPS can be described a priori, the prior knowledge of its concrete internals and surrounding environment is unlikely available <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. In this context, the likelihood of a given observation sequence ( y t ) T t=1 is inferred from the model of the expected behavior of the system by using the probabilistic forward algorithm. This algorithm computes the likelihood of all the possible sequences of hidden states given the observation sequence ( y t ) T t=1 . The likelihood of a particular sequence of hidden states ( t ) T t=1 given the observation sequence ( y t ) T t=1 is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">p ( t ) T t=1 |( y t ) T t=1 = p( 1 ) × p( 1 | y 1 ) ×   T t=2 p( (t) | (t-1) ) × p( (t) | y (t) )  <label>(1)</label></formula><p>Some works have extended the HMM in the framework of the Transferable Belief Model (TBM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, an elaboration on the Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) of evidence where tolerances towards uncertainties are neither described by probabilities but by belief functions. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, the author describes previous works in using HMM with TBM <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> in the context of analyzing time series and denoted as Evidential HMM (EvHMM). Probability-based HMM is built upon the Closed World Assumption (CWA), i.e. probabilities are spread on the states { 1 , . . . ,  N } defined in the model with N =1 p(  ) = 1, i.e. p(Ω) = 1 and p(∅) = 0. TBM, on his side, is built upon the Open World Assumption (OWA). It allows to associate a belief value (mass of conflict m) to the empty set, i.e. m(∅) ≥ 0, meant to quantify the degree of inconsistency of the observations with regards to the model. This is coherent with the meaning we seek to give to the measure of effectiveness. In this context, it is proven in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> that the plausibility of the observation sequence to have been produced by the model, i.e. the plausibility of the model, is given by p(Ω) = 1m(∅) obtained from the evidential forward algorithm, likewise the likelihood obtained from the probabilistic forward algorithm. Close to the concern of CPS behavioral analysis, the case of Evidential HMM with application to dynamical system analysis is described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. However, HMM-based methods do not consider state-transitions probabilities governed by inputs necessary in modeling CPS expected behavior. A way to cope with this limitation is to use the Input/Output HMM (IOHMM), first introduced in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. With this modeling framework, state-transitions probabilities are not hardcoded as it is the case with HMMs. Instead, the probability of a state-transition to occur depends on some input values. In this context, the observation sequence consists in an input sequence (  t ) T t=1 and an output sequence ( y t ) T t=1 . In this context, the likelihood of a particular sequence of hidden states ( t ) T t=1 given the sequences (  t ) T t=1 and ( y t ) T t=1 is given by :</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">p ( t ) T t=1 , (  t , y t ) T t=1 = p( 1 ) × p( 1 | y 1 ) ×   T t=2 p( (t) | (t-1) ,  (t-1) ) × p( (t) | y (t) )  <label>(2)</label></formula><p>pros &amp; cons: a key advantage here is that these models are interpretable, making clear <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> the mapping between the variables and the observations, (2) the description of the zones of viability through probabilities or belief functions. In this category, HMM-based modeling frameworks and more particularly the IOHMM where state-transitions probabilities depend on some input values, are well suited for representing dynamical systems <ref type="bibr">[32][33]</ref>. Moreover, such models assume that the internals and the environment of the systems considered are not necessarily known a priori. This makes sense in the context of CPS that, with regards to their complexity, are unlikely to be comprehensively modeled. At best, one can define their expected behavior through the effects they are supposed to produce in response to some events. By assuming OWA, the Ev-IOHMM would be a good candidate so as to compute the degree of effectiveness of CPS. However, to date, no effort has been put on elaborating on such modeling framework.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Contributions</head><p>In this paper, we do extend previous works on the probabilistic and the possibilistic IOHMM likelihood-based approaches respectively described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> in the framework of the TBM (we denote Ev-IOHMM). The work done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> being considered as the starting points, the main contributions of this paper are the following:</p><p>1. The degree of effectiveness is formally defined and generalized in the context of the measure and the viability theories, 2. The probabilistic IOHMM described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> is extended into the TBM framework, resulting in the Ev-IOHMM. To this end, we do rely on previous contributions done on extending HMM to EvHMM <ref type="bibr">[29][27]</ref>. The associated evidential forward algorithm is provided and used for inferring the likelihood of the input/output observations to have been generated by the model whose zones of viability are neither defined through probabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> nor possibilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> but by belief functions.</p><p>3. The Evaluation of the approach is carried out on a simple yet revealing example, complemented with a list of use-cases emphasizing its interest. Among these use-cases, we do elaborate on a use-case in the domain of autonomous vehicles. The idea is to leverage the proposed approach as means for designers to benchmark the control systems of these vehicles by relying on the measure of their effectiveness against constraints of the highway code relative to speed limitations and passengers well-being, both modeled through an Ev-IOHMM.</p></div>

While no inhabitant is present in the room (characterized by pres &lt; 3) then the value provided from the luminosity sensor should be less than 5 (characterized by m &lt; 5). Here m = p = 1. Here, one may see a parallel with unit tests performed in software engineering for validating an algorithm. Some inputs are provided to the algorithm. The output, resulting from the treatment of these inputs by the algorithm, is compared with an expected output value. In this context, let us imagine one want to test that the sequence (  t , y t ) T t=1 leads the sequence of states ( t ) T t=1 : the algorithm under test is the one controlling the CPS considered. The deterministic model of the expected behavior, here, plays the role of an unit test defined as follows :</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">1  (t) ( (t-1) ,  (t-1) ) = 1 if  (t-1) ∈ ( (t) | (t-1) ) 0 otherwise 1  (t) ( y (t) ) = 1 if y (t) ∈ ψ  (t) 0 otherwise</formula><p>The result of the test is then computed by :</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Test( ( t ) T t=1 Expected result , (  t , y t ) T t=1 npts ) = T t=2 1  (t) ( (t-1) ,  (t-1) ) × 1  (t) ( y (t) )<label>(4)</label></formula><p>without room for tolerance towards uncertainties, the test result can only be PASS or FAIL, i.e. ∈ {0, 1}.</p><p>However, without being perfect, the luminosity level at 22.8 (state  2 in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) when an inhabitant is present may be still acceptable and effectiveness ∈ [0, 1]. So, one needs to extend the deterministic model allowing to define tolerances pertaining the following uncertainties:</p><p>-The aleatory uncertainties which are most likely objective and relative to the natural variability of the physical properties of interest whose values over time are most likely distributed around an average value, -The epistemic uncertainties which are most likely subjective and relative to users' satisfaction towards the physical system evolution.</p><p>Besides these uncertainties, one may also consider reliability uncertainties such as:</p><p>-The spatial uncertainties relative to the sensors location with respect to the physical property of interest, -The hardware uncertainties relative to the sensors accuracy and resolution, -The model uncertainties relative to the designer of the model and its expertise on the application domain.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">An application to autonomous vehicles</head><p>Autonomous vehicles are gaining momentum in the CPS community. Although promising a breakthrough in terms of traffic optimization and regulation, these vehicles will be unable to fulfil their potential without ensuring safety of passengers and surroundings. Besides the physical environment these vehicles operate in and in which unanticipated events may hamper their operation at any time, these vehicles are also prone to cyber attacks, potential communication infrastructure and electronic devices issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>. For designers, it is then about handling the behavior of these vehicles from an holistic point of view rather than considering each part of the system separately <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>. Thus, by modeling the expected behavior of the system taken as a whole rather than considering its internals, the proposed approach is coherent with the holistic point of view.</p><p>This section aims at providing a possible application of the method developed throughout the paper to the domain of autonomous vehicles. The proposed application consists in providing autonomous vehicles designers with a bench-marking tool used for assessing the effectiveness of the controllers of these vehicles. Without claiming to be exhaustive, the solution can be used in addition to existing approaches for autonomous vehicles security and safety. Two scenarios are then considered. The first one is about considering the speed limitations in force in France. Such limitation rules are complex and depend on several factors depicted in  The idea here is to prevent the vehicle going beyond the maximum speed allowed taking into account factors depicted in Table .9. The second scenario consists in considering passengers' well being. The idea here is to prevent rapid accelerations and decelerations of the vehicle especially when meeting humps, roundabout, "giveway", etc.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Methodology</head><p>OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a collaborative map of the world. It is a powerful source of information about all types of infrastructure features such as roads, trails, side-walks, etc. Specifically, given GPS longitude and latitude, one can retrieve from the repository all information about the infrastructure around. Our approach is to use this repository so as to gather infrastructure information from GPS data at each time t as the vehicle moves. Besides OSM, we do use a weather web service (api.weatherbit.io) allowing us to retrieve weather information at the date of interest.</p><p>Based on these information, we do first describe the Ev-HMM model corresponding to the first scenario. The model for the second scenario is built upon the same approach. The inputs of the associated Ev-IOHMM are gathered from some OSM features of interest, i.e, traffic_calming:hump, traffic_calming:choker, highway:stop and highway:give_way, taking value of "1.0" if the feature is detected around, "0.0" otherwise. The output of the Ev-IOHMM corresponds to the constraint on the acceleration and deceleration while being in each state. Instant acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle is computed based on the delta of speed and the delta of the distance travelled between two time steps (cce =  (t+n) - (t) n</p><p>). The corresponding Ev-HMM model is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Note 5.</head><p>In these scenarios, we do assume the behavioral constraints are defined by the designer of the model. For instance, for the first scenario, the maximum speed limits in force are subject to tolerances inherent to radar systems accuracy (generally, in the 5% range) that cannot be retrieved from learning. For the second scenario, tolerances may be adjusted based on users' feedback or from their preferences.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Results</head><p>To complete the experimentations, a C# library has been developed based on the Matlab functions developed by Philippe Smets <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>. The library has been further extended with combination rules (CRC and DRC <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>) and normalization rules (Dempster <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, Yager <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, and Dubois-Prade <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>). A mobile phone application is further used for recording GPS data from several drivers. The traces recorded are then post-processed in order to add, based on latitude and longitude information, the OSM infrastructure features of interest near the location of the vehicle along with the weather data, based on timestamp. The post processor aims at generating a dataset that can be replayed from a graphical interface built using Node-Red <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref> and in which the Ev-IOHMM models are instantiated for evaluation (see Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">9</ref>). The degree of effectiveness is then assessed using the Ev-IOHMM models described in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> and Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref>.

A sliding window is applied : after the first observation sequence is gathered, each new observation triggers the computation of the degree of effectiveness (sliding window = 1).</p><p>Results are provided in Fig. <ref type="figure">10</ref>. It is worth noting that the proposed approach is not predictive, i.e. the degree of effectiveness is computed based on the last T observations. The length T depends on the sampling rate of the sensors, the Ev-IOHMM model and the physical process whose evolution is observed. By applying a sliding window on the observations, once the window has been filled up with T observations, one can get the computation of the degree of effectiveness performed upon each new observation. Results obtained may help designers of autonomous vehicles to benchmark the controllers for different situations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Conclusion and perspectives</head><p>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are computing systems whose purposes are achieved from interactions with the physical world by means of transducers (sensors and actuators). These systems pose new challenges in terms of dependability, the evolution of the physical systems they control being affected by unanticipated physical processes over which they have no control and which may potentially hamper the achievement of their purposes. It is now recognized that designers of such systems can no longer lean, at design time, on comprehensive and reliable models for anticipating and removing faults that may arise once these systems are deployed. Instead, they have to be monitored in vivo and quantitatively evaluated for effectiveness throughout their life cycle.</p><p>In this paper, we formally defined and generalized the notion of effectiveness in the context of the measure and viability theories. We further detailed the mathematical properties the measure has to comply with in the context of assessing CPS effectiveness. The measure is further developed in the Transferable Belief Model (TBM) framework, an elaboration of the Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) of evidence. The proposed approach is intended to have several applications in the context of benchmarking and assessment of Quality of Experience (QoE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref>:</p><p>-The measure can be used as a benchmarking tool. For instance, let us consider the case of autonomous driving. One might be interested in comparing algorithms used to control autonomous vehicles according to the highway code. As a future work, we do plan to apply the proposed approach to this use-case based on the UAH-DriveSet <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>.</p><p>-Assuming the expected evolution of the physical system being driven by the CPS is specified by the users (e.g. through end-user programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>), the degree of effectiveness might give a direct insight on users' satisfaction, i.e. QoE as an assessment of the human satisfaction when interacting with technology and business entities in a particular context.</p><p>The proposed approach may also provide an added value in self-adaptive systems:</p><p>-In the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), many physical devices now expose services available to ubiquitous computing systems leveraging them for composing the so-called ambient applications (e.g. smart-home, smart-city, etc.). The question then arises for these systems of how to select the relevant services. Current approaches rely on semantic annotations used to formally describe the services <ref type="bibr">[67][68]</ref>. While this approach is relevant, (1) semantic annotations are pure models, agnostic to the target operational environment, (2) the behavior of a composed application cannot be inferred solely given the individual behavior of the services it is composed with. Hence, observing the concrete behavior of these systems and providing them with a feedback through the measure of effectiveness would help them selecting more appropriate services over time.</p><p>-More generally, self-adaptive systems pose new challenges in term of assurance, i.e. the ability to provide evidence that these systems satisfy their behavioral requirements, irrespective of the adaptations over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>. One may envision leveraging the assessment proposed in this paper within a feedback loop providing CPS with self-awareness capability allowing them to react towards any deviation.</p><p>However, although promising, the proposed approach suffers from limitations :</p><p>-The approach is not predictive, the measure is computed based on past events. This could be a problem for safety critical CPS for which an immediate response is required, -As such, the Ev-IOHMM cannot manage temporal constraints which are of importance in the CPS context. Following what has been done on Hidden Semi-Markov Models (HSMM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref>, we do plan to develop the Ev-IOHSMM where temporal constraints are used to specify the maximum amount of time allowed to switch from one state to another one or to specify the maximum time one is allowed to stay in a particular state, -The Ev-IOHMM is memory greedy, it implies 2 |Ω| × 2 |Ω| elements in the state-transition matrix A. For instance, for the first scenario described in section 5, the model of the expected behavior contains 11 states leading a 2048×2048 state-transition matrix. The complexity in time of the forward algorithm described in 4.3.3 is O(2 2|Ω| T) when using commonalities q Ω . By using plausibilities p Ω , the complexity is O(2 |Ω| T) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. As a recommendation, when |Ω| is large, it is preferable to avoid matrix calculus and use the binary format as means to encode focal elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>,</p><p>-Finally, it is assumed that sensors required for measuring the effectiveness are available. First, it might not be the case and one needs to assess cost/benefits of adding the required sensors. Second, it might be the case but with sensors not as relevant as desired (for instance, a luminosity sensor is made available but not exactly at the desired location). In that case, one can determine some contextual discounting factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, but the challenge remains on the determination of the discounting factor values.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>lum &lt; 5 Figure 1 :</head><label>51</label><figDesc>Figure1: Deterministic model describing the expected evolution of a physical system (here a room whose luminosity level is supposed to change depending on whether an inhabitant is present or not).</figDesc></figure>
