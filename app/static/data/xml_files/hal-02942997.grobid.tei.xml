<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Dwork et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> quantify the privacy level ε in εdifferential privacy (or ε-DP) as an upper bound on the worst-case privacy loss incurred by a privacy-preserving mechanism. Generally, a privacy-preserving mechanism perturbs the results by adding the calibrated amount of random noise to them. The calibration of noise depends on the sensitivity of the query and the specified privacy level. In a real-world setting, a data steward must specify a privacy level that balances the requirements of the users and monetary constraints of the business entity. For example, Garfinkel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> report on issues encountered when deploying differential privacy as the privacy definition by the US census bureau. They highlight the lack of analytical methods to choose the privacy level. They also report empirical studies that show the loss in utility due to the application of privacypreserving mechanisms.</p><p>We address the dilemma of a data steward in two ways. Firstly, we propose a probabilistic quantification of privacy levels. Probabilistic quantification of privacy levels provides a data steward with a way to take quantified risks under the desired utility of the data. We refer to the probabilistic quantification as privacy at risk. We also derive a composition theorem that leverages privacy at risk. Secondly, we propose a cost model that links the privacy level to a monetary budget. This cost model helps the data steward to choose the privacy level constrained on the estimated budget and vice versa. Convexity of the proposed cost model ensures the existence of a unique privacy at risk that would minimise the budget. We show that the composition with an optimal privacy at risk provides stronger privacy guarantees than the traditional advanced composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In the end, we illustrate a realistic scenario that exemplifies how the data steward can avoid overestimation of the budget by using the proposed cost model by using privacy at risk.</p><p>The probabilistic quantification of privacy levels depends on two sources of randomness: the explicit randomness induced by the noise distribution and the implicit randomness induced by the data-generation distribution. Often, these two sources are coupled with each other. We require analytical forms of both sources of randomness as well as an analytical representation of the query to derive a privacy guarantee. Computing the probabilistic quantification of different sources of randomness is generally a challenging task. Although we find multiple probabilistic privacy definitions in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> , we miss an analytical quantification bridging the randomness and privacy level of a privacypreserving mechanism. We propose a probabilistic quantification, namely privacy at risk, that further leads to analytical relation between privacy and randomness. We derive a composition theorem with privacy at risk for mechanisms with the same as well as varying privacy levels. It is an extension of the advanced composition theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> that deals with a sequential and adaptive use of privacy-preserving mechanisms. We also prove that privacy at risk satisfies convexity over privacy levels and a weak relaxation of the post-processing property. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to analytically derive the proposed probabilistic quantification for the widely used Laplace mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The privacy level proposed by the differential privacy framework is too abstract a quantity to be integrated in a business setting. We propose a cost model that maps the privacy level to a monetary budget. The proposed model is a convex function of the privacy level, which further leads to a convex cost model for privacy at risk. Hence, it has a unique probabilistic privacy level that minimises the cost. We illustrate this using a realistic scenario in a GDPR-compliant business entity that needs an estimation of the compensation budget that it needs to pay to stakeholders in the unfortunate event of a personal data breach. The illustration, which uses the proposed convex cost model, shows that the use of probabilistic privacy levels avoids overestimation of the compensation budget without sacrificing utility. The illustration naturally extends to any convex cost model.</p><p>In this work, we comparatively evaluate the privacy guarantees using privacy at risk of the Laplace mechanism. We quantitatively compare the composition under the optimal privacy at risk, which is estimated using the cost model, with traditional composition mechanismsbasic and advanced mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. We observe that it gives stronger privacy guarantees than the ones obtained by the advanced composition without sacrificing on the utility of the mechanism.</p><p>In conclusion, benefits of the probabilistic quantification i.e., of the privacy at risk are twofold. It not only quantifies the privacy level for a given privacypreserving mechanism but also facilitates decisionmaking in problems that focus on the privacy-utility trade-off and the compensation budget minimisation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Background</head><p>We consider a universe of datasets D. We explicitly mention when we consider that the datasets are sampled from a data-generation distribution G with support D. Two datasets of equal cardinality x and y are said to be neighbouring datasets if they differ in one data point. A pair of neighbouring datasets is denoted by x ∼ y. In this work, we focus on a specific class of queries called numeric queries. A numeric query f is a function that maps a dataset into a real-valued vector, i.e. f : D → R k . For instance, a sum query returns the sum of the values in a dataset.</p><p>In order to achieve a privacy guarantee, researchers use a privacy-preserving mechanism, or mechanism in short, which is a randomised algorithm that adds noise to the query from a given family of distributions. Thus, a privacy-preserving mechanism of a given family, M(f, Θ), for the query f and the set of parameters Θ of the given noise distribution, is a function i.e. M(f, Θ) : D → R. In the case of numerical queries, R is R k . We denote a privacy-preserving mechanism as M, when the query and the parameters are clear from the context. Definition 1 (Differential Privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>). A privacypreserving mechanism M, equipped with a query f and with parameters Θ, is (ε, δ)-differentially private if for all Z ⊆ Range(M) and x, y ∈ D such that x ∼ y:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">P(M(f, Θ)(x) ∈ Z) ≤ e ε × P(M(f, Θ)(y) ∈ Z) + δ.</formula><p>An (ε, 0)-differentially private mechanism is also simply said to be ε-differentially private. Often, ε-differential privacy is referred to as pure differential privacy whereas (ε, δ)-differential privacy is referred as approximate differential privacy.</p><p>A privacy-preserving mechanism provides perfect privacy if it yields indistinguishable outputs for all neighbouring input datasets. The privacy level ε quantifies the privacy guarantee provided by ε-differential privacy. For a given query, the smaller the value of the ε, the qualitatively higher the privacy. A randomised algorithm that is ε-differentially private is also ε -differential private for any ε &gt; ε.</p><p>In order to satisfy ε-differential privacy, the parameters of a privacy-preserving mechanism requires a calculated calibration. The amount of noise required to achieve a specified privacy level depends on the query. If the output of the query does not change drastically for two neighbouring datasets, then a small amount of noise is required to achieve a given privacy level. The measure of such fluctuations is called the sensitivity of the query. The parameters of a privacy-preserving mechanism are calibrated using the sensitivity of the query that quantifies the smoothness of a numeric query.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 2 (Sensitivity). The sensitivity of a query</head><formula xml:id="formula_1">f : D → R k is defined as ∆ f max x,y∈D x∼y f (x) -f (y) 1 .</formula><p>The Laplace mechanism is a privacy-preserving mechanism that adds scaled noise sampled from a calibrated Laplace distribution to the numeric query.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Privacy at Risk: A Probabilistic Quantification of Randomness</head><p>The parameters of a privacy-preserving mechanism are calibrated using the privacy level and the sensitivity of the query. A data steward needs to choose an appropriate privacy level for practical implementation. Lee et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> show that the choice of an actual privacy level by a data steward in regard to her business requirements is a non-trivial task. Recall that the privacy level in the definition of differential privacy corresponds to the worst case privacy loss. Business users are however used to taking and managing risks, if the risks can be quantified. For instance, Jorion <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> defines Value at Risk that is used by risk analysts to quantify the loss in investments for a given portfolio and an acceptable confidence bound. Motivated by the formulation of Value at Risk, we propose to use the use of probabilistic privacy level. It provides us with a finer tuning of an ε 0differentially private privacy-preserving mechanism for a specified risk γ.</p><p>Definition 5 (Privacy at Risk). For a given data generating distribution G, a privacy-preserving mechanism M, equipped with a query f and with parameters Θ, satisfies ε-differential privacy with a privacy at risk 0 ≤ γ ≤ 1 if, for all Z ⊆ Range(M) and x, y sampled from G such that x ∼ y:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P ln P(M(f, Θ)(x) ∈ Z) P(M(f, Θ)(y) ∈ Z) &gt; ε ≤ γ, (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">)</formula><p>where the outer probability is calculated with respect to the probability space Range(M • G) obtained by applying the privacy-preserving mechanism M on the datageneration distribution G.</p><p>If a privacy-preserving mechanism is ε 0 -differentially private for a given query f and parameters Θ, for any privacy level ε ≥ ε 0 , the privacy at risk is 0. We are interested in quantifying the risk γ with which an ε 0 -differentially private privacy-preserving mechanism also satisfies a stronger ε-differential privacy, i.e., with ε &lt; ε 0 .</p><p>Unifying Probabilistic and Random DP Interestingly, Equation (1) unifies the notions of probabilistic differential privacy and random differential privacy by accounting for both sources of randomness in a privacy-preserving mechanism. Machanavajjhala et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> define probabilistic differential privacy that incorporates the explicit randomness of the noise distribution of the privacy-preserving mechanism, whereas Hall et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> define random differential privacy that incorporates the implicit randomness of the data-generation distribution. In probabilistic differential privacy, the outer probability is computed over the sample space of Range(M) and all datasets are equally probable.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Connection with Approximate DP</head><p>Despite a resemblance with probabilistic relaxations of differential privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> due to the added parameter δ, (ε, δ)-differential privacy (Definition 1) is a nonprobabilistic variant <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> of regular ε-differential privacy. Indeed, unlike the auxiliary parameters in probabilistic relaxations, such as γ in privacy at risk (ref.</p><p>Definition 5), the parameter δ of approximate differential privacy is an absolute slack that is independent of the sources of randomness. For a specified choice of ε and δ, one can analytically compute a matching value of δ for a new value of ε 2 . Therefore, as other probabilistic relaxations, privacy at risk cannot be directly related to approximate differential privacy. An alternative is to find out a privacy at risk level γ for a given privacy level (ε, δ) while the original noise satisfies (ε 0 , δ).</p><p>Theorem 2. If a privacy preserving mechanism satisfies (ε, γ) privacy at risk, it also satisfies (ε, γ) approximate differential privacy.</p><p>We obtain this reduction as the probability measure induced by the privacy preserving mechanism and data generating distribution on any output set Z ⊆ Range(M) is additive. 3 The proof of the theorem is in Appendix A.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Composition theorem</head><p>The application of ε-differential privacy to many realworld problem suffers from the degradation of privacy guarantee, i.e., privacy level, over the composition. The basic composition theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> dictates that the privacy guarantee degrades linearly in the number of evaluations of the mechanism. The advanced composition theorem <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> provides a finer analysis of the privacy loss 2 For any 0 &lt; ε ≤ ε, any (ε, δ)-differentially private mechanism also satisfies (ε , (e εe ε + δ))-differential privacy.</p><p>3 The converse is not true as explained before.</p><p>over multiple evaluations with a square root dependence on the number of evaluations. In this section, we provide the composition theorem for privacy at risk. Definition 6 (Privacy loss random variable). For a privacy-preserving mechanism M : D → R, any two neighbouring datasets x, y ∈ D and an output r ∈ R, the value of the privacy loss random variable C is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">C(r) ln P(M(x) = r) P(M(y) = r)</formula><p>.</p><p>Lemma 1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Convexity and Post-Processing</head><p>We show that privacy at risk satisfies the convexity property and does not satisfy the post-processing property.</p><p>Lemma 2 (Convexity). For a given ε 0 -differentially private privacy-preserving mechanism, privacy at risk satisfies the convexity property.</p><p>Proof. Let M be a mechanism that satisfies ε 0differential privacy. By the definition of the privacy at risk, it also satisfies (ε 1 , γ 1 )-privacy at risk as well as (ε 2 , γ 2 )-privacy at risk for some ε 1 , ε 2 ≤ ε 0 and appropriately computed values of γ 1 and γ 2 . Let M 1 and M 2 denote the hypothetical mechanisms that satisfy (ε 1 , γ 1 )-privacy at risk and (ε 2 , γ 2 )-privacy at risk respectively. We can write privacy loss random variables as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">C 1 ≤ γ 1 ε 1 + (1 -γ 1 )ε 0 C 2 ≤ γ 2 ε 2 + (1 -γ 2 )ε 0</formula><p>where C 1 and C 2 denote privacy loss random variables for M 1 and M 2 .</p><p>Let us consider a privacy-preserving mechanism M that uses M 1 with a probability p and M 2 with a probability (1-p) for some p ∈ [0, 1]. By using the techniques in the proof of Theorem 3, the privacy loss random variable C for M can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">C = pC 1 + (1 -p)C 2 ≤ γ ε + (1 -γ )ε 0 where ε = pγ 1 ε 1 + (1 -p)γ 2 ε 2 pγ 1 + (1 -p)γ 2 γ = (1 -pγ 1 -(1 -p)γ 2 )</formula><p>Thus, M satisfies (ε , γ )-privacy at risk. This proves that privacy at risk satisfies convexity [23, Axiom 2.1.2].</p><p>Meiser <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> proved that a relaxation of differential privacy that provides probabilistic bounds on the privacy loss random variable does not satisfy post-processing property of differential privacy. Privacy at risk is indeed such a probabilistic relaxation.</p><p>Corollary 2 (Post-processing). Privacy at risk does not satisfy the post-processing property for every possible mapping of the output.</p><p>Though privacy at risk is not preserved after postprocessing, it yields a weaker guarantee in terms of approximate differential privacy after post-processing. The proof involves reduction of privacy at risk to approximate differential privacy and preservation of approximate differential privacy under post-processing.</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">Lemma 3 (Weak Post-processing). Let M : D → R ⊆</formula><p>R k be a mechanism that satisfy (ε, γ)-privacy at risk and f : R → R be any arbitrary data independent mapping. Then, f • M : D → R would also satisfy (ε, γ)approximate differential privacy.</p><p>Proof. Let us fix a pair of neighbouring datasets x and y, and also an event Z ⊆ R . Let us define pre-image of Z as Z {r ∈ R : f (r) ∈ Z}. Now, we get</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">P(f • M(x) ∈ Z ) = P(M(x) ∈ Z) ≤ (a) e ε P(M(y) ∈ Z) + γ = e ε P(f • M(y) ∈ Z ) + δ (a) is a direct consequence of Theorem 2.</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Privacy at Risk for Laplace Mechanism</head><p>The Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms are widely used privacy-preserving mechanisms in the literature. The Laplace mechanism satisfies pure ε-differential privacy whereas the Gaussian mechanism satisfies approximate (ε, δ)-differential privacy. As previously discussed, it is not straightforward to establish a connection between the non-probabilistic parameter δ of approximate differential privacy and the probabilistic bound γ of privacy at risk. Therefore, we keep privacy at risk for Gaussian mechanism as the future work.</p><p>In this section, we instantiate privacy at risk for the Laplace mechanism in three cases: two cases involving two sources of randomness and a third case involving the coupled effect. These three different cases correspond to three different interpretations of the confidence level, represented by the parameter γ, corresponding to three interpretations of the support of the outer probability in Definition 5. In order to highlight this nuance, we denote the confidence levels corresponding to the three cases and their three sources of randomness as γ 1 , γ 2 , and γ 3 , respectively.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">The Case of Implicit Randomness</head><p>In this section, we study the effect of the implicit randomness induced by the data-generation distribution to provide a fine tuning for the Laplace mechanism. We fine-tune the risk for a specified privacy level without assuming that the sensitivity of the query.</p><p>If one takes into account randomness induced by the data-generation distribution, all pairs of neighbouring datasets are not equally probable. This leads to estimation of sensitivity of a query for a specified datageneration distribution. If we have access to an analytical form of the data-generation distribution and to the query, we could analytically derive the sensitivity distribution for the query. In general, we have access to the datasets, but not the data-generation distribution that generates them. We, therefore, statistically estimate sensitivity by constructing an empirical distribution. We call the sensitivity value obtained for a specified risk from the empirical cumulative distribution of sensitivity the sampled sensitivity (Definition 7). However, the value of sampled sensitivity is simply an estimate of the sensitivity for a specified risk. In order to capture this additional uncertainty introduced by the estimation from the empirical sensitivity distribution rather than the true unknown distribution, we compute a lower bound on the accuracy of this estimation. This lower bound yields a probabilistic lower bound on the specified risk. We refer to it as empirical risk. For a specified absolute risk γ 2 , we denote by γ2 corresponding empirical risk.</p><p>For the Laplace mechanism L ∆ S f ε calibrated with sampled sensitivity ∆ S f and privacy level ε, we evaluate the empirical risk γ2 . We present the result in Theorem 5. The proof is available in Appendix C. </p><formula xml:id="formula_26">f : D → R k is γ2 ≥ γ 2 (1 -2e -2ρ 2 n ) (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_27">)</formula><p>where n is the number of samples used for estimation of the sampled sensitivity and ρ is the accuracy parameter. γ 2 denotes the specified absolute risk.</p><p>The error parameter ρ controls the closeness between the empirical cumulative distribution of the sensitivity to the true cumulative distribution of the sensitivity. Lower the value of the error, closer is the empirical cumulative distribution to the true cumulative distribution. Mathematically,</p><formula xml:id="formula_28">ρ ≥ sup ∆ |F n S (∆) -F S (∆)|,</formula><p>where F n S is the empirical cumulative distribution of sensitivity after n samples and F S is the actual cumulative distribution of sensitivity.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> shows the plot of number of samples as a function of the privacy at risk and the error parameter. Naturally, we require higher number of samples in order to have lower error rate. The number of samples reduces as the privacy at risk increases. The lower risk demands precision in the estimated sampled sensitivity, which in turn requires larger number of samples.</p><p>If the analytical form of the data-generation distribution is not known a priori, the empirical distribution of sensitivity can be estimated in two ways. The first way is to fit a known distribution on the available data and later use it to build an empirical distribution of the sensitivities. The second way is to sub-sample from a large dataset in order to build an empirical distribution of the sensitivities. In both of these ways, the empirical distribution of sensitivities captures the inherent randomness in the data-generation distribution. The first way suffers from the goodness of the fit of the known distribution to the available data. An ill-fit distribution does not reflect the true data-generation distribution and hence introduces errors in the sensitivity estimation. Since the second way involves subsampling, it is immune to this problem. The quality of sensitivity estimates obtained by sub-sampling the datasets depend on the availability of large population. Let, G denotes the data-generation distribution, either known apriori or constructed by subsampling the available data. We adopt the procedure of <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> to sample two neighbouring datasets with p data points each. We sample p -1 data points from G that are common to both of these datasets and later two more data points, independently. From those two points, we allot one data point to each of the two datasets.</p><p>Let, S f = f (x) -f (y) 1 denotes the sensitivity random variable for a given query f , where x and y are two neighbouring datasets sampled from G. Using n pairs of neighbouring datasets sampled from G, we construct the empirical cumulative distribution, F n , for the sensitivity random variable. Definition 7. For a given query f and for a specified risk γ 2 , sampled sensitivity, ∆ S f , is defined as the value of sensitivity random variable that is estimated using its empirical cumulative distribution function, F n , constructed using n pairs of neighbouring datasets sampled from the data-generation distribution G.</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">∆ S f F -1 n (γ 2 )</formula><p>If we knew analytical form of the data generation distribution, we could analytically derive the cumulative distribution function of the sensitivity, F , and find the sensitivity of the query as ∆ f = F -1 (1). Therefore, in order to have the sampled sensitivity close to the sensitivity of the query, we require the empirical cumulative distributions to be close to the cumulative distribution of the sensitivity. We use this insight to derive the analytical bound in the Theorem 5.</p></div>

In order to avoid misuse of this data, we require a legal framework that not only limits the use of the collected data but also proposes reparative measures in case of a data leak. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 4 is such a legal framework. Section 82 in GDPR states that any person who suffers from material or non-material damage as a result of a personal data breach has the right to demand compensation from the data processor. Therefore, every GDPR compliant business entity that either holds or processes personal data needs to secure a certain budget in the scenario of the personal data breach. In order to reduce the risk of such an unfortunate event, the business entity may use privacy-preserving mechanisms that provide provable privacy guarantees while publishing their results. In order to calculate the compensation budget for a business entity, we devise a cost model that maps the privacy guarantees provided by differential privacy and privacy at risk to monetary costs. The discussions demonstrate the usefulness of probabilistic quantification of differential privacy in a business setting.</p><p>4 https://gdpr-info.eu/</p></div>

We show that it is possible by fine-tuning the Laplace mechanism. Under the consideration of the explicit randomness introduced by the Laplace noise distribution, we show that ε 0 -differentially private Laplace mechanism also satisfies ε-differential privacy with risk γ, which is computed using the formula in Theorem 4.

In every scenario, the data steward is given a privacy at risk level ε and the confidence level γ and wants to disclose the parameters of a ridge regression model that she trains on the census dataset.

Section 4.1). In this scenario, the data steward knows the sensitivity for the ridge regression. She needs to compute the privacy level, ε 0 , to calibrate the Laplace mechanism. She uses Equation 3 that links the desired privacy at risk level ε, the confidence level γ 1 and the privacy level of noise ε 0 . Specifically, for given ε and γ 1 , she computes ε 0 by solving the equation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">γ 1 P(T ≤ ε 0 ) -P(T ≤ ε) = 0.</formula><p>Since the equation does not give an analytical formula for ε 0 , the data steward uses a root finding algorithm such as Newton-Raphson method <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> to solve the above equation.

Additionally, we observe that the choice of privacy level 0.8 instead of 0.4 to calibrate the Laplace mechanism gives lower utility loss for the data steward.

Section 4.3). In this scenario, the data steward does not know the sensitivity of ridge regression. She is not allowed to sample more than n times from a population dataset. For a given confidence level γ 2 and the privacy at risk ε, she calibrates the Laplace mechanism using illustration for Section 4.3. The privacy level in this calibration yields utility loss that is more than her requirement. Therefore, she wants to re-calibrate the Laplace mechanism in order to reduce utility loss.</p><p>For the re-calibration, the data steward uses privacy level of the pre-calibrated Laplace mechanism, i.e. ε, as the privacy at risk level and she provides a new confidence level for empirical privacy at risk γ3 .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Related Work</head><p>Calibration of mechanisms. Researchers have proposed different privacy-preserving mechanisms to make different queries differentially private. These mechanisms can be broadly classified into two categories. In one category, the mechanisms explicitly add calibrated noise, such as Laplace noise in the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> or Gaussian noise in the work of <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, to the outputs of the query. In the other category, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref> propose mechanisms that alter the query function so that the modified function satisfies differentially privacy. Privacy-preserving mechanisms in both of these categories perturb the original output of the query and make it difficult for a malicious data analyst to recover the original output of the query. These mechanisms induce randomness us-ing the explicit noise distribution. Calibration of these mechanisms require the knowledge of the sensitivity of the query. Nissim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> consider the implicit randomness in the data-generation distribution to compute an estimate of the sensitivity. The authors propose the smooth sensitivity function that is an envelope over the local sensitivities for all individual datasets. Local sensitivity of a dataset is the maximum change in the value of the query over all of its neighboring datasets. In general, it is not easy to analytically estimate the smooth sensitivity function for a general query. Rubinstein et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref> also study the inherent randomness in the datageneration algorithm. We adopt their approach of sampling the sensitivity from the empirical distribution of the sensitivity. They use order statistics to choose a particular value of the sensitivity. We use the risk, which provides a mediation tool for business entities to assess the actual business risks, on the sensitivity distribution to estimate the sensitivity.</p><p>Refinements of differential privacy. In order to account for both sources of randomness, refinements of ε-differential privacy are proposed in order to bound the probability of occurrence of worst case scenarios. Machanavajjhala et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> propose probabilistic differential privacy that considers upper bounds of the worst case privacy loss for corresponding confidence levels on the noise distribution. Definition of probabilistic differential privacy incorporates the explicit randomness induced by the noise distribution and bounds the probability over the space of noisy outputs to satisfy the ε-differential privacy definition. Dwork et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> propose Concentrated differential privacy that considers the expected values of the privacy loss random variables for the corresponding. Definition of concentrated differential privacy incorporates the explicit randomness induced by the noise distribution but considering only the expected value of privacy loss satisfying ε-differential privacy definition instead of using the confidence levels limits its scope.</p><p>Hall et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> propose random differential privacy that considers the privacy loss for corresponding confidence levels on the implicit randomness in the datageneration distribution. Definition of random differential privacy incorporates the implicit randomness induced by the data-generation distribution and bounds the probability over the space of datasets generated from the given distribution to satisfy the ε-differential privacy definition. Dwork et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> define approximate differential privacy by adding a constant bias to the privacy guarantee provided by the differential privacy. It is not a probabilistic refinement of the differential privacy.</p><p>Around the same time of our work, Triastcyn et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> independently propose Bayesian differential privacy that takes into account both of the sources of randomness. Despite this similarity, our works differ in multiple dimensions. Firstly, they have shown the reduction of their definition to a variant of Renyi differential privacy. The variant depends on the data-generation distribution. Secondly, they rely on the moment accountant for the composition of the mechanisms. Lastly, they do not provide a finer case-by-case analysis of the source of randomness, which leads to analytical solutions for the privacy guarantee.</p><p>Kifer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> define Pufferfish privacy framework, and its variant by Bassily et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, that considers randomness due to data-generation distribution as well as noise distribution. Despite the generality of their approach, the framework relies on the domain expert to define a set of secrets that they want to protect.</p><p>We refer interested readers to <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> for an extensive review of the differential privacy and its refinements.</p><p>Composition theorem. Recently proposed technique of the moment accountant <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> has become the state-of-the-art of composing mechanisms in the area of privacy-preserving machine learning. <ref type="bibr">Abadi et al.</ref> show that the moment accountant provides much strong privacy guarantees than the conventional composition mechanisms. It works by keeping track of various moments of privacy loss random variable and use the bounds on them to provide privacy guarantees. The moment accountant requires access to data-generation distribution to compute the bounds on the moment. Hence, the privacy guarantees are specific to the dataset.</p><p>Cost models. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> propose game theoretic methods that provide the means to evaluate the monetary cost of differential privacy. Pejó et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> also propose a game theoretic cost model in the setting of private collaborative learning. Our approach is inspired by the approach in the work of Hsu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. They model the cost under a scenario of a research study wherein the participants are reimbursed for their participation. Our cost modelling is driven by the scenario of securing a compensation budget in compliance with GDPR. Our requirement differs from the requirements of <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, particularly in our model participants do not have any monetary incentive to share their data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion and Future Works</head><p>In this paper, we provide a means to fine-tune the privacy level of a privacy-preserving mechanism by analysing various sources of randomness. Such a finetuning leads to probabilistic quantification on privacy levels with quantified risks, which we call as privacy at risk. We also provide composition theorem that leverages privacy at risk. We analytical calculate privacy at risk for Laplace mechanism. We propose a cost model that bridges the gap between the privacy level and the compensation budget estimated by a GDPR compliant business entity. Convexity of the cost function ensures existence of unique privacy at risk that minimises compensation budget. The cost model helps in not only reinforcing the ease of application in a business setting but also providing stronger privacy guarantees on the composition of mechanism.</p><p>It is possible to instantiate privacy at risk for Gaussian mechanism. The mechanism is (ε, δ)-differential private for γ = 0 and a non-zero risk calculated by accounting for the sources of randomness. We save it for future work. Privacy at risk may be fully analytically computed in cases where the data-generation, or the sensitivity distribution, the noise distribution and the query are analytically known and take convenient forms. We are now looking at such convenient but realistic cases.</p></div>

This non-zero probability guides us to calculate the privacy at risk γ 1 for the privacy at risk level ε. In order to get an intuition, we illustrate the calculation of the overlap between two Laplace distributions as an estimator of similarity between the two distributions. Definition 8. [Overlap of Distributions, <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>] The overlap, O, between two probability densities P 1 , P 2 with support X is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">O = X min[P 1 (x), P 2 (x)] dx.</formula></div>

Thus, L ∆ f 0.6 induces noise that is more than 80% times similar to the noise induced by L ∆ f 1.0 . Therefore, we can loosely say that at least 80% of the times a Laplace Mechanism L ∆ f 1.0 will provide the same privacy as a Laplace Mechanism L ∆ f 0.8 . Although the overlap between Laplace distributions with different scales offers an insight into the relationship between different privacy levels, it does not capture the constraint induced by the sensitivity. For a given query f , the amount of noise required to satisfy differential privacy is commensurate to the sensitivity of the query. This calibration puts a constraint on the noise that is required to be induced on a pair of neighbouring datasets.
