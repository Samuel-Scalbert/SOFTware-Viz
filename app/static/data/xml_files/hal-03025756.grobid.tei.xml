<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Object detection is a popular task in computer vision that aims at localizing objects through bounding boxes and assigning each of them to a predefined class. Deep learning-based methods largely dominate this research field and most recent methods are based on the anchor mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. Anchors are predefined reference boxes of different sizes and aspect ratios uniformly stacked over the whole image. They help the network to handle object scale and shape variations by converting the object detection problem into an anchor-wise bounding box regression and classification problem. Most state-of-the-art anchor-based object detectors resort to the Intersection over Union (IoU) between the predefined anchor boxes and the ground truth boxes (called IoU anchor in the following) to assign the sample anchors to an object (positive anchors) or a background (negative anchors) category. These assigned anchors are then used to minimize the bounding box regression and classification losses during training.</p><p>This IoU anchor -based anchor matching criterion is reasonable under the assumption that anchor boxes with high IoU anchor are appropriate for localization and classification. However, in reality, the IoU anchor is insensitive to objects' content/context, thus not "optimal" to be used, as such, for anchor matching. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we show several examples where IoU anchor does not well reflect the matching quality between anchors and objects: anchors A and anchors B have exactly the same IoU anchor but possess very different matching qualities. For example, on the first line of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, anchors A covers a more representative and informative part of the object than anchors B; On the second line, anchors B contains parts of a nearby object which hinders the prediction on the jockey/left person.</p><p>Deep learning-based object detection involves two sub-tasks: instance localization and classification. Predictions for these two tasks tell us "where" and "what" objects are on the image respectively. During the training phase, both tasks are jointly optimized by gradient descent, but the static anchor matching strategy does not explicitly benefit from the joint resolution of the two tasks, which may then yield to a task-misalignment problem, i.e., during the evaluation phase, the model might generate predictions with correct classification but imprecisely localized bounding boxes as well as predictions with precise localization but wrong classification. Both predictions significantly reduce the overall detection quality.</p><p>To address these two limitations of the existing IoU anchor -based strategy, we propose a new, adaptive anchor matching criterion guided by the localization and by the classification tasks mutually, i.e., resorting to the bounding box regression prediction, we dynamically assign training anchor samples for optimizing classification and vice versa. In particular, we constrain anchors that are well-localized to also be well-classified (Localize to Classify), and those well-classified to also be well-localized (Classify to Localize). These strategies lead to a content/contextsensitive anchor matching and avoid the task-misalignment problem. Despite the simplicity of the proposed strategy, Mutual Guidance brings consistent Average Precision (AP) gains over the traditional static strategy with different deep learning architectures on PASCAL VOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and MS COCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> datasets, especially on strict metrics such as AP75. Our method is expected to be more efficient on applications that require a precise instance localization, e.g., autonomous driving, robotics, outdoor video surveillance, etc.</p><p>The main contributions of our work can be summarized as follows:</p><p>-We suggest a new perspective for anchor matching in object detection, i.e., assign anchor labels for one task according to the predictions on the other task and vice versa. -We visualize the difference of anchor matching and object detection results between static methods and Mutual Guidance, to explore the reasons of performance improvements.</p><p>The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we discuss some representative related work in object detection. Section 3 provides implementation details of the proposed Mutual Guidance. Section 4 compares our dynamic anchor matching criterion to the traditional static criterion with different deep learning architectures on different public object detection datasets, and discusses reasons for the precision improvements. Section 5 brings concluding remarks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related work</head><p>Modern CNN-based object detection methods can be divided into two major categories: two-stage detectors and single-stage ones. Both categories give similar performance with a small edge in accuracy for the former and in efficiency for the latter. Besides, both categories of detectors are massively based on the anchor mechanism which usually resorts to IoU anchor for evaluating the matching quality between anchors and objects when assigning training labels and computing the bounding box regression and classification losses for a training example. Our method aims to improve this anchor matching criterion.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Anchor-based object detection</head><p>Two-stage object detectors. Faster RCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> defines the generic paradigm for two-stage object detectors: it first generates a sparse set of Regions of Interest (RoIs) with a Region Proposal Network (RPN), then classifies these regions and refines their bounding boxes. The RoIs are generated by the anchor mechanism. Multiple improvements have been proposed based on this framework: R-FCN <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> suggests position-sensitive score maps to share almost all computations on the entire image; FPN <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> uses a top-down architecture and lateral connections to build high-level semantic feature maps at all scales; PANet <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> enhances the multi-scale feature fusion by adding bottom-up path augmentation to introduce accurate localization signals in lower layers; Libra RCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> proposes the Balanced Feature Pyramid to further integrate multi-scale information into FPN; TridentNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> constructs a parallel multi-branch architecture and adopts a scale-aware training scheme for training object scale specialized detection branches. Cascade RCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> further extends the two-stage paradigm into a multi-stage paradigm, where a sequence of detectors are trained stage by stage.</p><p>Single-stage object detectors. SSD <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and YOLO <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> are the fundamental methods for single-stage object detection. From this basis, many other works have been proposed: FSSD <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> aggregates contextual information into the detector by concatenating features of different scales; RetinaNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> proposes the Focal Loss to tackle the imbalanced classification problem that arises when trying to separate the actual object to detect from the massive background; RFBNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> proposes Receptive Field Block, which takes the relationship between the size and the eccentricity of the reception fields into account; RefineDet <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> introduces an additional stage of refinement for anchor boxes; M2Det <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> stacks multiple thinned U-shape modules to tackle the so-called appearance-complexity variations. While these methods introduce novel architectures to improve results for the object detection task, they all rely on the standard IoU anchor -based matching. We identify this component as a possible limitation and propose a novel matching criterion, that could be adapted to any existing deep architecture for object detection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Anchor-free object detection</head><p>The idea of anchor-free object detection consists in detecting objects not from predefined anchors boxes, but directly from particular key-points <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> or object centres <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. However, these methods do not lead to a substantial accuracy advantage compared to anchor-based methods. The main idea of our Mutual Guidance could also be applied to this class of object detectors, and the experimental results with anchor-free detectors are included in the supplementary material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Approach</head><p>As already sketched in the introduction, in order to train an anchor-based object detector, the predefined anchors should be assigned as positive ("it is a true object") or negative ("it is a part of the background") according to an evaluation of the matching between the anchors and the ground truth objects. Then, the bounding box regression loss is optimized according to the positive anchors, and the instance classification loss is optimized according to the positive as well as the negative anchors. When training an anchor-based single-stage object detector with a static anchor matching strategy, the IoU between predefined anchor boxes and ground truth boxes (IoU anchor ) is the usual matching criterion. As shown in the IoU anchor column of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, anchors with more than 50% of IoU anchor are labelled as "positive", those with less than 40% of IoU anchor are labelled as "negative", the rest are "ignored anchors". Note that at least one anchor should be assigned as positive, hence if there is no anchor with more than 50% of IoU anchor , the anchor with the highest IoU anchor is considered.</p><p>The proposed Mutual Guidance consists of two components: Localize to Classify and Classify to Localize.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Localize to Classify</head><p>If an anchor is capable to precisely localize an object, this anchor must cover a good part of the semantically important area of this object and thus could be considered as an appropriate positive sample for classification. Drawing on this, we propose to leverage the IoU between regressed bounding boxes (i.e., the network's localization predictions) and ground truth boxes (noted IoU regressed ) to better assign the anchor labels for classification. Inspired by the usual IoU anchor , we compare IoU regressed to some given thresholds (discussed in the next paragraph) and then define anchors with IoU regressed greater than a high threshold as positive samples, and those with IoU regressed lower than a low threshold as negative samples (see IoU regressed column of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</p><p>We now discuss a dynamic solution to set the thresholds. A fixed threshold (e.g., 50% or 40%) does not seem optimal since the network's localization ability gradually improves during the training procedure and so does the IoU regressed for each anchor, leading to the assignment of more and more positive anchors which destabilizes the training. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic thresholding strategy. Even though the IoU anchor is not the best choice to accurately indicate the matching quality between anchors and objects, the number of assigned positive and ignored anchors does reflect the global matching conditions (brought by the size and the aspect ratio of the objects to detect), thus these numbers could be considered as reference values for our dynamic criterion. As illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, while applying the IoU anchor -based anchor matching strategy with the thresholds being 50% and 40%, the number of positive anchors (N p ) and ignored anchors (N i ) are noted (N p = 6 and N i = 3 for the boat). We then use these numbers to label the N p highest IoU regressed anchors as positive, and the following N i anchors as ignored. More formally, we exploit the N p -th largest IoU regressed as our positive anchor threshold, and the (N p +N i )-th largest IoU regressed as our ignored anchor threshold. Using this, our Localize to Classify anchor matching strategy evolves with the network's localization capacity and maintains a consistent number of anchor samples assigned to both categories (positive/negative) during the whole training procedure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Classify to localize</head><p>As with the Localize to Classify process, the positive anchor samples in Classify to Localize are assigned according to the network's classification predictions (noted Classif score). Specifically, Classif score is the predicted classification score for the object category, e.g., the Classif score of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> indicates the classification score for the boat category.</p><p>Nevertheless, this Classif score is not effective enough to be used directly for assigning good positive anchors for the bounding box regression optimization. It is especially true at the beginning of the training process, when the network's weights are almost random values and all predicted classification scores are close to zero. The IoU regressed is optimized on the basis of the IoU anchor , therefore we have IoU regressed â¥ IoU anchor in most cases (even at the beginning of the training), and this property helps to avoid such cold start problem and ensures training stability. Symmetrically to the Localize to Classify strategy, we now propose a Classify to Localize strategy based on an IoU amplif ied defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">IoU amplif ied = (IoU anchor ) Ï-p Ï (<label>1</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_1">)</formula><p>where Ï is a hyper-parameter aiming at adjusting the degree of amplification, p represents the mentioned Classif score. Its behavior is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.</p><p>The IoU amplif ied is always higher than the IoU anchor , and the amplification is proportional to the predicted Classif score. In particular, the amplification is stronger for smaller Ï (note that Ï should be larger than 1), and disappears when Ï becomes large.</p><p>Similarly to the Localize to Classify strategy, we apply a dynamic thresholding strategy to keep the number of assigned positive samples for the localization task and for the classification task consistent, e.g., we assign in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the top 6 anchors with the highest IoU amplif ied as positive samples. Note that there is no need for selecting ignored or negative anchors for the localization task since the background does not have an associated ground truth box.</p><p>As discussed in Section 1, IoU anchor is not sensitive to the content or the context of an object. Our proposed Localize to Classify and Classify to Localize, however, attempt to adaptively label the anchor samples according to their visual content and context information. Considering anchor F and anchor H in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, one can tell that anchor H is better than anchor F for recognizing this boat, even with a smaller IoU anchor . Using both our strategies, anchor H has been promoted to positive thanks to its excellent prediction quality on both tasks whereas anchor F has been labelled as negative even though it has a large IoU anchor .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">About the task-misalignment problem</head><p>Since Localize to Classify and Classify to Localize are independent strategies, they could possibly assign contradictory labels (e.g, the anchor C in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> is labelled negative for the classification task but positive for the bounding box regression task). This happens when one anchor entails a good prediction on one task and a poor prediction on the other (i.e. they are misaligned predictions). Dealing with such contradictory labels, as we do with Mutual Guidance, does not destabilize the training process. On the contrary, it tackles the task-misalignment problem since the labels for one task is assigned according to the prediction quality on the other task, and vice versa. This mechanism enforces the network to generate aligned predictions.</p><p>For example, if one anchor is good at classification but poor at localization, for the localization task, the Mutual Guidance will assign this anchor positive to encourage this anchor to be good at localization as well; in the same time, for the classification task, considering its localization prediction is poor, in order to avoid misaligned predictions, the Mutual Guidance will assign this anchor negative to encourage this anchor to be classified as "background". In fact, the predicted classification score of this mislocalized anchor should be low enough to be suppressed by the NMS procedure of evaluation phase. If one anchor is good at localization but poor at classification, its classification label will be assigned as positive to encourage good predictions on both tasks, however, considering its classification prediction is poor (i.e., this anchor contains one part of the object but it is classified as "background"), its localization has no need to be optimized since this detection will not survive in the NMS procedure of evaluation phase.</p><p>If the assigned labels are always the same for both tasks (as done in IoU anchorbased method), it cannot be guaranteed that one anchor's prediction on both tasks (localization and classification) are good at the same time. The NMS will only keep detection results with the highest classification score, so we may end up with keeping predictions with good classification and poor localization for evaluation, which is harmful for strict metrics such as AP75.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Experimental Setting</head><p>Network architecture and parameters. In order to test the generalization performance of the proposed method, we implement our method on the single-stage object detectors FSSD <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, RetinaNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and RFBNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> using both ResNet-18 <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> or VGG-16 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> as backbone networks in our experiments. Note that RFBNet is not implemented with ResNet-18 as backbone since the two architectures are not compatible. The backbone networks are pre-trained on ImageNet-1k classification dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. We adopt the Focal Loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and Balanced L1 Loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> as our instance classification and bounding box regression loss functions respectively for all experiments. The input image resolution is fixed to 320 Ã 320 pixels for all experiments (single scale training and evaluation). Unless specified, all other implementation details are the same as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Following the results of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, we decided to fix our only new hyper-parameter Ï to 2 for all experiments. Ï is used to set the degree of amplification when computing IoU amplif ied in Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>). It needs to be greater than 1 for the exponent to be positive and lower than 3 since this does not bring any amplification as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>.</p><p>Datasets and evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments are performed on two benchmark datasets: PASCAL VOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and MS COCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. PASCAL VOC dataset has 20 object categories. Similarly to previous works, we utilize the combination of VOC2007 and VOC2012 trainval sets for training, and rely on the VOC2007 test for evaluation. MS COCO dataset contains 80 classes. Our experiments on this dataset are conducted on the train2017 and val2017 set for training and evaluation respectively. For all datasets, we use the evaluation metrics introduced in the MS COCO benchmark: the Average Precision (AP) averaged over 10 IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95, but also AP50, AP75, AP s , AP m , AP l . AP50 and AP75 measure the average precision for a given IoU threshold (50% and 75%, respectively). The last three aim at focusing on small (area &lt; 32 2 ), medium (32 2 &lt; area &lt; 96 2 ) and large (area &gt; 96 2 ) objects respectively. Since the size of the objects greatly varies between MS COCO and PASCAL VOC, these size-dependent measures are ignored when experimenting with PASCAL VOC dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results</head><p>Experiments on PASCAL VOC. We evaluate the effectiveness of both components (Localize to Classify and Classify to Localize) of our proposed approach w.r.t. the usual IoU anchor -based matching strategy when applied on the same deep learning architectures. The results obtained on the PASCAL VOC dataset are given in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>. Both proposed anchor matching strategies consistently boost the performance of the "vanilla" networks and their combination (Mutual Guidance) leads to the best AP and all other evaluation metrics. In particular, we observe that the improvements are small on AP50 (around 0.5%) but significant on AP75 (around 3%), which means that we obtain more precise detections. As analysed in Section 3.3, this comes from the task-misalignment problem faced with the usual static anchor matching methods. This issue leads to retain well-classified but poorly-localized predictions and suppress well-localized but poorly-classified predictions, which in turns results in a significant drop of the AP score at strict IoU thresholds, e.g., AP75. In Mutual Guidance, however, training labels for one task are dynamically assigned according to the prediction quality on the other task and vice versa. This connection makes the classification and localization tasks consistent along all training phases and as such avoids this task-misalignment problem.</p><p>We also notice that Localize to Classify alone brings, for all five architectures, a higher improvement than Classify to Localize alone. We hypothesize two possible reasons for this: 1) most object detection errors come from wrong classification instead of imprecise localization, so the classification task is more difficult than the localization task and thus, there is more room for the improvement on this task; 2) the amplification proposed in Eq. (1) may not be the most appropriate one to take advantage of the classification task for optimizing the bounding box regression task. Experiments on MS COCO. We then conduct experiments on the more difficult MS COCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> dataset and report our results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. Note that according to the scale range defined by MS COCO, APs of small, medium and large objects are listed. In this dataset also, our Mutual Guidance strategy consistently brings some performance gains compared to the IoU anchor -based baselines. We notice that our AP gains on large objects is significant (around 2%). This is because larger objects generally have more matched positive anchors, which offers more room for improvements to our method. Since the Mutual guidance strategy only involves the training phase, and since there is no difference between IoU anchorbased and our method during the evaluation phase, these improvements can be considered cost-free.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Qualitative analysis</head><p>Label assignment visualization. Here, we would like to explore the reasons for the performance improvements by visualizing the difference in the label assignment between the IoU anchor -based strategy and the Mutual Guidance strategy during training. Some examples are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>. White dotted-line boxes represent ground truth boxes; Red anchor boxes are assigned as positive by IoU anchor -based strategy, while considered as negative or ignored by Localize to Classify (the top two lines in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>) or Classify to Localize (the bottom two lines in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref>); Green anchor boxes are assigned as positive by Localize to Classify but negative or ignored by IoU anchor -based; Yellow anchor boxes are assigned as positive by Classify to Localize but negative or ignored by IoU anchorbased. From these examples, we can conclude that the IoU anchor -based strategy only assigns the "positive" label to anchors with sufficient IoU with the ground truth box, regardless of their content/context, whereas our proposed Localize to Classify and Localize to Classify strategies dynamically assign "positive" labels to anchors covering semantic discriminant parts of the object (e.g., upper body of a person, main body of animals), and assign "negative" labels to anchors with complex background, occluded parts, or anchors containing nearby objects. We believe that our proposed instance-adaptive strategies make the label assignment more reasonable, which is the main reason for performance increase.</p><p>Detection results visualization. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref> illustrates on a few images from the PASCAL VOC dataset the different behaviours shown by our Mutual Guidance method and the baseline anchor matching strategy. As analysed in Section 3.3, we can find misaligned predictions (good at classification but poor at localization) from IoU anchor -based anchor matching strategy. As shown in the figure, our method gives better results when different objects are close to each other in the image, e.g. "man riding a horse" or "man riding a bike". With the usual IoU anchor -based anchor matching strategy, the instance localization and classification tasks are optimized independently of each other. Hence, it is possible that, during the evaluation phase, the classification prediction relies on one object whereas the bounding box regression targets the other object. However, such a problem is rarer with the Mutual Guidance strategy. Apparently, our anchor matching strategies introduce interactions between both tasks and makes the predictions of localization and classification aligned, which substantially eliminated such false positive predictions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we question the use of the IoU between predefined anchor boxes and ground truth boxes as a good criterion for anchor matching in object detection and study the interdependence of the two sub-tasks (i.e. localization and classification) involved in the detection process. We propose a Mutual Guidance mechanism, which provides an adaptive matching between anchors and objects by assigning anchor labels for one task according to the prediction quality on the other task and vice versa. We assess our method on different architectures and different public datasets and compare it with the traditional static anchor matching strategy.
