<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Argumentation is used by people both internally, by evaluating arguments and counterarguments to make a decision, and externally, e.g., by exchanging arguments to reach an agreement or to promote a position. A major component of the argumentation process concerns the assessment of a set of arguments and of their conclusions in order to establish their justification status, and therefore compute their acceptability degree. The assessment of the justification status of the statements supported by arguments allows the agent to decide what to believe and what to do. Argumentation semantics provide formal criteria to determine which sets of arguments (i.e., extensions) can be regarded as collectively acceptable (Baroni, Caminada, and Giacomin 2011). However, the assessment of the arguments acceptability is only a (basic) part of the complex assessment tasks required in argumentative processes in many everyday life applications, e.g., in medicine and education.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MARRO</head><p>Assessing argumentation is a crucial issue in the context of artificial argumentation, encompassing various aspects such as identifying real natural language arguments and their relations in text, computing the justification status of abstract arguments, and gradually evaluating arguments. While some approaches have tackled the automatic assessment of natural language arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Wachsmuth et al. 2017</ref><ref type="bibr">(Wachsmuth et al. , 2020))</ref>, this issue remains largely unresolved.</p><p>In this paper, we address this open issue and we answer the following research question: what are the basic quality dimensions to characterize natural language argumentation and how to automatically assess them?</p><p>More precisely, we propose an Argument Mining (AM) approach to identify and classify natural language arguments along with quality dimensions.</p><p>In this work, we decide to characterize argument quality along with three quality dimensions for natural language argumentation, i.e., cogency, rhetoric, and reasonableness. The assessment of cogency involves determining the acceptability and sufficiency of the premises that support an argument's conclusion, while rhetoric identifies the use of rhetorical strategies such as ethos, logos, and pathos in the argument's conclusion. Additionally, reasonableness rates whether the argument effectively rebuts counterarguments, assessing the dialectical quality dimension of the argumentation.</p><p>Our interest focuses on the education scenario, where students are asked to interact with our AM system to assess the quality of their persuasive essays with respect to these three quality dimensions.

Our approach automates the evaluation process proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Stapleton and Wu (2015)</ref> in social science by utilizing a scoring rubric for persuasive writing that combines the assessment of argumentative structural elements and reasoning quality.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A major component of the argumentation process concerns the assessment of a set of arguments and of their conclusions to establish their justification status, and therefore compute their acceptability degree <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baroni et al., 2011)</ref>. Both qualitative and quantitative approaches have been proposed in the literature to assess the acceptance of an argument. However, the assessment of the arguments acceptability is only a (basic) part of the complex assessment tasks required in argumentative processes in many everyday life applications and contexts, e.g., in medicine and education.</p><p>The issue of assessing an argumentation is particularly critical when considering the different aspects of artificial argumentation, from the identification of real natural language arguments and their relations in text, to the computation of the justification status of abstract arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Baroni et al., 2011)</ref>, to the gradual assessment of arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Amgoud et al., 2022)</ref> based, e.g., on the trustworthiness of the argument proponents <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(da Costa Pereira et al., 2011)</ref> or on the value promoted by the argument <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bench-Capon, 2003)</ref>. Despite some approaches addressing the automatic assessment of natural language arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Wachsmuth et al., 2017)</ref>, this issue remains largely unexplored and unsolved. In this paper, we address this open issue, and we answer the following research questions: (i) what are the basic quality dimensions to characterize natural language argumentation? and (ii) how to automatically assess these quality dimensions on natural language argumentative text?</p><p>More specifically, we propose an argument mining <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cabrio and Villata, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Lawrence and Reed, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Lauscher et al., 2022)</ref> approach to identify and classify natural language arguments along with quality dimensions. We first define and annotate three prominent quality dimensions for natural language argumentation, i.e., cogency, rhetoric, and reasonableness, on an existing dataset of student persuasive essays <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Stab and Gurevych, 2017)</ref>. We then train a neural network model classifier empowered with properties from the argument graphs to address the task. Our core contribution is twofold:</p><p>• We enrich a linguistic resource of persuasive essays <ref type="bibr">(1908 arguments)</ref> with a new annotation layer, i.e., the quality dimensions of cogency, rhetoric, and reasonableness. This paper is motivated by the lack of natural language argumentation resources annotated with quality dimensions, and the need for effective methods to address this task. Our contribution offers a novel resource and method to advance the field.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Recent approaches in Argument(ation) Mining (AM) tackle specific argument qualities features, such as argument relevancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Wachsmuth, 2017)</ref>, convincing arguments <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Habernal, 2016)</ref> and overall argument quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Toledo, 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Defining the characteristics of a good and successful argument is a hard task. First, we must address the several text rating procedures proposed in the literature. Different factors, such as the aim of the assessment, the freedom given to the raters, and the number of texts to be analyzed should be considered when evaluating the quality of argumentative texts. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Coertjens et al., 2017)</ref>, rating procedures can be classified in two dimensions: Holistic vs. analytic and absolute vs. comparative. Holistic rating entails evaluating texts as a complete entity, while analytic rating involves assessing multiple text features. In absolute ratings, each text is assessed based on a predefined criteria or description, while in comparative ratings, texts are compared to each other to determine their score. In this study, our objective is to assess the quality of argumentative texts in persuasive essays through the application of a consistent and absolute analytic rating system. The aim is to ensure that the evaluation is based solely on the essay's content, rather than the subjective bias of the evaluator, and that the assessment results are consistent across all raters.</p><p>A commonly used rating method is rubrics. In an analytic rubric, text features are predetermined, but the weight assigned to each feature may not be predetermined. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Coertjens et al. 2017)</ref> found that evaluators may assign different weights to predetermined text features, potentially leading to variations in assessments of a single text among evaluators.</p><p>To tackle this issue, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Stapleton and Wu, 2015)</ref> describe the weight of the separate text features in a rubric as fixed. In this rubric, the authors stated that a strong argumentative text is composed of two important elements. (i) an argumentative text must be constructed considering all elements contributing to a good quality of argumentation and (ii) attention must be paid to the quality of the content of the text.</p><p>Different approaches have been proposed to assess both points from a logical, rhetorical, and dialectical point of view. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Wachsmuth (2017)</ref>, derive a taxonomy of argumentation quality that systematically decomposes quality assessment based on the interactions of 15 widely accepted quality dimensions. The three main characteristics are Cogency, Effectiveness and Reasonableness. As a follow up, <ref type="bibr">Wachsmuth (2020)</ref>, investigate how effectively each dimension can be automatically assessed, modelling features such as content, style, length, and subjectivity. This text-only assessment yields moderate learning success for most of the evaluated dimensions.</p><p>Following the work by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Stapleton and Wu. 2015)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Wachsmuth et al. 2017)</ref>, we argue that it is important to evaluate both the quality of argumentation and the quality of the content to provide a complete assessment of the argumentative texts. We, therefore, advance the state of the art of natural language argument quality assessment by investigating three main quality properties of persuasive essays (i.e., cogency, reasonableness, and rhetorical strategy) using the rubric provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Stapleton and Wu. 2015)</ref>. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to evaluate argument reasonableness by integrating cogency properties with the argumentation graph structure.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Quality dimensions of persuasive essays</head><p>To annotate the quality dimensions on persuasive essays, we rely on the corpus built by <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Stab and Gurevych, 2017)</ref>, containing 402 persuasive essays annotated with the argument components (i.e., evidence, claims and major claims) and relations (i.e., support or attack). We add a new annotation layer by manually labelling for each argument in the essays the following three quality attributes: cogency, reasonableness, and argumentation rhetoric.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Annotation guidelines</head><p>Given that our goal is to assess persuasive essays written by students, we rely on an absolute analytic quality evaluation process proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Stapleton and Wu. 2015)</ref>. The authors propose a scoring rubric for persuasive writing that integrates the assessment of both argumentative structural elements and reasoning quality. This rubric contemplates several characteristics of the standard definition of Cogency and Reasonableness, such as Relevancy, Acceptability, and Soundness as well as the presence of counterarguments and rebuttals. Tables I, II and III show the analytic scoring rubrics proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Stapleton and Wu. 2015)</ref>. A scale of 0, 10, 15, 20, 25 is given to assess the Cogency and Reasonableness of a given argument.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Definition 1. Cogency An argument should be seen as cogent if it has individually</head><p>acceptable premises that are relevant to the argument's conclusion and that are sufficient to draw the conclusion <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Wachsmuth et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. Analytic Scoring Rubric for assessing Cogency <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Stapleton and Wu, 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Following Table <ref type="table">I</ref>, we define the acceptable premises as the ones that are worthy of being believed, and the relevant one as those that contribute to the acceptance or rejection of the argument's conclusion. These criteria are considered in point (b) (Table <ref type="table">I</ref>) whilst the structural information about the argument graph is addressed in point (a). Examples 1, 2, 3 show the cogency annotation on three different persuasive essays from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Stab and Gurevych, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>Example 1. We should attach more importance to cooperation during primary education. [Through cooperation, children can learn about interpersonal skills which are significant in the future life of all students]1.[What we acquired from team work is not only how to achieve the same goal with others but more importantly, how to get along with others]1. [During the process of cooperation, children can learn about how to listen to opinions of others, how to communicate with others, how to think comprehensively, and even how to compromise with other team members when conflicts occurred]2. [All of these skills help them to get on well with other people and will benefit them for the whole life]3. The first sentence represents the major claim, while the claim to be assessed is in bold and the premises supporting it are in italics. Example 1 is annotated with cogency score 25, given that the author presents multiple premises which are acceptable and relevant to draw a conclusion. Example 2 shows a cogency score of 15, given that the author presents two premises that are relevant to the topic but not sufficient to draw the conclusion. Finally, Example 3 is annotated with a cogency score 0, given that the author does not presents a premise to support the claim. Definition 2. Reasonableness An argumentation should be seen as reasonable if it contributes to the resolution of the given issue in a sufficient way that is acceptable to the target audience <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Wachsmuth et al., 2017)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MARRO</head><p>The Analytic Scoring Rubric for Reasonableness (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">II</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table III</ref>) integrates these concepts and follows the idea of evaluating the argumentation graph with a focus on the counterarguments and their respective rebuttals. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Stapleton and Wu. 2015)</ref> separates the evaluation of Reasonableness for two different argumentative components, the counterarguments, and the rebuttals. The rubric score given to evaluate the reasonableness of the counterarguments (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">II</ref>) stipulates an analysis on the cogency of the counterargument, providing the same definitions given in Table <ref type="table">I</ref>. Similarly to cogency and reasonableness counterargument, an evaluation on the soundness and acceptability of the text is required for the evaluation of the rebuttals (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">III</ref>). However, it differs from the others when evaluating if (i) the rebuttal refutes the counterarguments and (ii) does so with a stronger reasoning quality.</p><p>To evaluate the Reasonableness of an argument, one must analyze its counterarguments and related rebuttals. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>, the reasonableness quality dimension is assessed following Tables <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">II</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_3">III</ref>. Counterargument Claim E receives a Score 0 for Reasonableness Counterargument as no supporting reasons or premises are provided. In contrast, for the rebuttal, Claim F provides a sound premise and stronger reasoning quality than the counterargument, resulting in a Score 25 for Reasonableness Rebuttal. Argumentation Rhetoric. Annotators were asked to evaluate at the argument level which rhetoric strategy the argument is following among ethos, logos, and pathos <ref type="bibr">(Aristotle, 2004)</ref>. Examples 6, 7, and 8 show the rhetorical strategy annotation on three different arguments from <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Stab and Gurevych, 2017)</ref>. [In a survey carried out in a university, it was asked to students that why did they start smoking, then around forty percent of individuals answered that they wanted to look like their favorite screen actor while smoking cigarettes]2 [Imitating celebrities has a negative influence on health of young individuals]3.</p><p>In Example 4 the claim (in bold) appeals to emotions Pathos when the author describes how "people are better taken care" in the premises 1 and 3 (in italic). In Example 5 the authors employ Ethos, we can notice that the author refers to personal experiences in premises 1 and 2. Example 6 employs Logos, the author refers to a formal study, in premise 2, to support its claim.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Inter-annotator agreement</head><p>Before starting the annotation process, three expert annotators carried out a training phase, during which they studied the guidelines and discussed about the ambiguities between the scores for the definitions of Cogency and Reasonableness, amongst others. Then, the annotators were presented with an argument from a persuasive essay and its full argument graph, and they had to annotate the argument quality following the rubric scores.</p><p>To ensure the reliability of the annotation task, the inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was calculated on a set of 33 essays, resulting in a Fleiss' kappa of 0.68 for Cogency, 0.78 for Reasonableness Counterargument, 0.84 for Reasonableness Rebuttal, and 0.85 for Argumentation Rhetoric. Despite this substantial agreement, the annotators encountered difficulty in selecting precise scores, such as 25 or 20. To address potential subjectivity issues in the manual annotation, we opted to merge Score 25 with Score 20 and Score 15 with Score 10, resulting in three labels (with Score 0 remaining unchanged).</p><p>After recalculating Fleiss' kappa score, we observed an increase only for Cogency (from 0.68 to 0.86). Therefore, we decided to use a three-label score (i.e., 0, 15, 25) for Cogency prediction, while keeping the more fine-grained score <ref type="bibr">(i.e., 0, 10, 15, 20, 25)</ref> for Reasonableness. Annotators then engaged in a reconciliation phase, where they resolved disagreements through discussion. One of the expert annotators performed the remaining annotation. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">IV</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_5">Table V report</ref>    </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Automatic assessment of argumentation</head><p>An overview of the automatic argument quality assessment framework we propose is visualized in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. Starting from the persuasive essays where argument components and their relations are identified, the goal is to assess the quality of each argument (i.e., the quality of each claim). Three scores are computed: a cogency score in the range {0, 15, 25}, an argumentation rhetoric label among ethos, logos, and pathos, and a reasonableness score in the range {0, 10, 15, 20, 25}. Two different methods are combined to assess the quality dimensions of the arguments: (i) the cogency score and the argumentation rhetoric labels are predicted using an attention-based neural architecture which employs the argumentation graphs through graph embeddings, and (ii) the reasonableness score is computed by means of an algorithm, combining the cogency score predicted at step (i) and the graph structure of each persuasive essay.</p><p>To feed the argumentative texts into the computational models we need to, first, convert them into vectorial representations called embeddings. In the following, we present the textual and graph embeddings we extracted from the persuasive essays to predict the cogency score and argumentation rhetoric labels, the architecture we define to predict these two quality dimensions, and conclude with the reasonableness algorithm used to assess this score.</p><p>Table VI summarizes our findings on the technical experiments for the automatic assessment of all quality dimensions, which are further discussed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Marro et al., 2022)</ref> Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>. Overview of our natural language argumentation quality prediction model.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Embeddings</head><p>We generate features using textual and graph embeddings. Embeddings are lowdimensional, continuous vector representations of real-world data, such as text or graphs, which capture semantics and similarity. For text, the meaning of the words is encoded in such a way that words that are close in the vector space are expected to be similar in meaning. Graph embeddings similarly transform graph properties into vectors to capture topology, vertex-to-vertex relationships, and any other relevant information.</p><p>To generate textual features, we employ various embedding approaches, such as GloVe <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Pennington et al., 2014)</ref> for static methods and Longformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Beltagy et al., 2020)</ref> for contextualized embeddings, among others. To create a textual representation of an argument, we considered not only the sentences in the claim but also those from related components that are linked to the claim by a support or attack relations (e.g., premises, counterarguments, and rebuttals) to reflect human evaluation of argument quality. For graph embeddings, we used the state-of-the-art FEATHER-G <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Rozemberczki and Sarkar, 2020)</ref> as our primary model.</p><p>To enrich our features for the Rhetoric dimension, we explored a way to obtain representations for the emotions present in the arguments. We utilized a state-ofthe-art system trained for the Emotion Recognition downstream task. This approach enabled us to obtain an emotion label from a set of six basic emotions (sadness, joy, love, anger, fear, or surprise), which was subsequently used to generate a word embedding via various techniques discussed earlier in this section.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Cogency and rhetoric scoring assessment</head><p>Following feature generation, we proceed to perform an automated assessment of each quality attribute. With regards to Cogency and Reasonableness, we present a range of models in our experimentation, including both standard baselines and advanced methods. Specifically, we evaluate our models using textual embeddings alone, as well as a combination of textual and graph embeddings.</p><p>Our findings, presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">VI</ref>, demonstrate a significant improvement in the performance of our system upon the inclusion of argument graph features. However, in our assessment of rhetorical strategies, we did not observe any such improvement with the incorporation of graph features, whereas the inclusion of emotion embeddings resulted in a positive impact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Reasonableness scoring assessment</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>MARRO</head><p>As counterarguments and rebuttals are scarce in our dataset, our models struggle to properly classify reasonableness. To address this, we propose a new approach that takes into account the structure of the argumentation graph, which plays a significant role in assessing reasonableness.</p><p>The reasonableness dimension <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Stapleton and Wu, 2015)</ref> considers (i) the cogency of the counterarguments attacking the argument we want to assess the reasonableness of, (ii) the cogency of the rebuttals to these counterarguments, and (iii) the relative number of rebuttals and counterarguments. This means that to effectively compute the reasonableness dimension, we need to combine the cogency-based quality of the argument components and the structure of the argumentation graph.</p><p>In <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Marro et al. 2022)</ref> we propose an algorithm to compute the reasonableness score of the arguments in the persuasive essays. In this Rebuttal Reasonableness Score algorithm, we define how each score is evaluated by combining the cogency values of the pertinent arguments and the relevant properties of the argument graph. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Final outcome</head><p>After automatically assessing the Cogency, Rhetoric, and Reasonableness dimensions, our system leverages the obtained scores to assist students in improving their essays. The pipeline concludes by automatically generating scores based on the following template:</p><p>The [QUALITY DIMENSION] of this argument is assessed as being [PREDICTED SCORE] as the argument [DEFINITION] (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Concluding remarks</head><p>We presented a novel approach to the task of automatic quality assessment of natural language argumentation. We built a new resource of 402 students' persuasive essays annotated with 3 different quality dimensions. We show that our neural architecture relying on a transformer-based model and graph embeddings can successfully classify arguments along with these quality dimensions. Our quality assessment method conjugates the empirical evaluation of the cogency dimension with the graph-based computation of the reasonableness one, which encompasses the quality (expressed in terms of cogency) of the counterarguments and the argumentation structure.</p><p>In the context of AI in education, we aim to include our automatic argument quality assessment pipeline into a larger framework where the system engages the student into an explanatory rule-based dialogue to assess her essays, explain why they obtained a certain quality score and how to improve them along with the considered quality dimensions.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Example 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Animals should live in natural habitats instead of zoos.
