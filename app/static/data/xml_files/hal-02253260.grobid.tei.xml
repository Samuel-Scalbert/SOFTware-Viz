<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This paper presents HydroShoot, a leaf-based functional-structural plant model (FSPM) that simulates gas-exchange rates of complex plant canopies under water deficit conditions. HydroShoot is built assuming that simulating both the hydraulic structure of the shoot together with the energy budget of individual leaves is the asset for successfully scaling-up leaf to canopy gas-exchange rates.</p><p>HydroShoot includes three interacting modules: hydraulic which calculates the distribution of xylem water potential across shoot hydraulic segments, energy which calculates the complete energy budget of individual leaves, and exchange which calculates net carbon assimilation and transpiration rates of individual leaves. HydroShoot was evaluated on virtual and real grapevines having strongly contrasted canopies, under well-watered and water deficit conditions. It captured accurately the impact of canopy architecture and soil water status on plant-scale gas-exchange rates and leaf-scale temperature and water potential. Both shoot hydraulic structure and leaf energy budget simulations were, as postulated, required to adequately scaling-up leaf to canopy gas-exchange rates. Notwithstanding, simulating shoot hydraulic structure was found more necessary to adequately performing this scaling task than simulating leaf energy budget. That is, the intra-canopy variability of leaf water potential was a better predictor of the reduction of whole plant gas-exchange rates under water deficit than the intra-canopy variability of leaf temperature. We conclude that simulating the shoot hydraulic structure is a prerequisite if FSPM's are to be used to assess gas-exchange rates of complex plant canopies as those of grapevines. Finally, HydroShoot is available through the OpenAlea platform (https://github.com/openalea/hydroshoot) as a set of reusable modules.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Climate change is seriously challenging viticulture sustainability in its current areas of production <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Hannah et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">van Leeuwen et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Duchêne et al., 2014)</ref>. One efficient shortterm solution for hampering the projected adverse effects of water and heat stress on viticulture, is to reconsider training systems so that they allow maximizing the ratio of carbon assimilation ( the design of canopy structures that are adapted to adverse environmental conditions is most efficiently performed with the aid of models able to accurately predict the influence of canopy architecture on its gas exchange rates and leaves temperature under combined water and heat stress.</p><p>That is what functional-structural plant models (FSPMs) offer <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Vos et al., 2010)</ref>.</p><p>FSPMs received nevertheless little attention in grapevine scientific literature to assess the impact of shoot architecture on plant gas-exchange rates <ref type="bibr">(Medrano et al., 2015 a)</ref>. This is probably due to the inherent complexity in scaling up eco-physiological processes from the leaf to the canopy level, as strong variability in gas exchange rates (CO 2 versus water vapor) exists inside the canopy driven by variations in micrometeorological conditions and leaf functional traits Hence, adequately predicting the intra-canopy variability of both leaf stomatal conductance and temperature stands out as the key challenge to using FSPMs to predict plant gas-exchange rates under water deficit conditions. Yet, the remaining question is how this variability can be accurately described and what are their main determinants.</p><p>Describing the intra-canopy variability of both leaf stomatal conductance and temperature requires from the one hand to explicitly describe their drivers as a function of leaf position inside the canopy, and from the other hand to adequately account for their mutual interactions (how stomatal aperture affects leaf energy budget and vice versa) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Chelle, 2005)</ref>. The main drivers for both processes are commonly determined as incident shortwave irradiance, air temperature, air humidity and leaf "water status" which determines stomatal closure <ref type="bibr">(Damour et al., 2010)</ref>. Among these drivers, leaf water status (which controls stomatal aperture and consequently both leaf transpiration and temperature) still makes no consensus in the scientific literature when it comes to determining what it refers to. A basal approach considers that leaf water status is equal to the soil water status (e.g. A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t</p><p>the rhizosphere impacts uniformly all leaves regardless of their position. By contrast, leaf water status may also be considered as a "local" water status specific to each individual leaf (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Tuzet et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Buckley et al., 2003)</ref> which results from the interplay between water demand (transpiration) and offer (xylem flow) at the leaf-scale, which are notably determined by the shoot hydraulic structure. This "local" approach mostly agrees with observations whereby stomatal closure is uneven across the canopy. Sunlit leaves, for instance, experience stronger water deficit than shaded leaves, and are therefore the first to undergo reductions in gas exchange rates under water deficit <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Escalona et al., 2003)</ref>. This "local" approach seems hence as the most adequate in FSPM's, however, the "remote" modelling approaches also proved satisfactory when individually considered. (e.g.  were built at the leaf-cluster scale which does not allow accounting for the location of individual leaves in plant hydraulic structure necessary to calculate local leaf water status. In addition, both models consider the "remote" action of the rhizosphere on stomatal aperture instead of the "local'</p><p>water status, assuming again as negligible the potential contribution of shoot hydraulic structure on shaping the intra-canopy variability of leaf stomatal conductance and temperature.</p><p>In this paper, it is postulated that intra-canopy variability in both leaf water potential and leaf temperature are the main drivers for adequately predicting photosynthesis and transpiration fluxes at the plant scale under water deficit conditions using FSPMs. This paper has threefold objective. The first is to describe HydroShoot, a leaf-scale-based FSPM that allows predicting whole plant transpiration A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t</p><p>and photosynthesis rates by scaling-up these processes from the leaf-level. This model uses as lever for this scaling process the simulation of the interactions between hydraulic structure of the shoot, the energy balance, and gas-exchange rates of individual leaves. The second objective is to evaluate the performance of the model using both virtual and real canopies with data collected on photosynthesis and transpiration rates (plant scale), and stomatal conductance and temperature (leaf scale). Finally, the third objective is to examine how detailed hydraulic structure and energy budget simulations determine the predicted gas-exchange rates at the plant scale under water deficit conditions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Materials and methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model structure and basic assumptions</head><p>HydroShoot is a static FSPM (with regards to plant structure) that takes plant shoot architecture, weather, and soil water conditions as inputs, and returns transpiration and net photosynthesis rates both of individual leaves and the whole plant at hourly time steps as outputs. It is conceived as a set of three modules which simulate water potential (hydraulic module), energy budget (energy module), and C 3 -type gas-exchange rates (exchange module). These three modules run jointly, having leaf xylem water potential and temperature at the leaf level as pivots (cf. implementation and numerical solution section). The formalisms used in each module are developed in the following sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Hydraulic module</head><p>The hydraulic module computes water potentials of plant segments (output of the module) as a function of water flow in the plant and water potential of the soil (input to the module). The whole plant is compartmentalized in elementary conducting elements corresponding to petioles, internodes of the current-year stems, and elements of previous-year trunk and branches (internodes or pruning complexes). Leaves are treated in this system as nodes letting water flow but having no gradient in their water potential ( ). A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t</p><p>Water transfer across the hydraulic segments is simulated by analogy to Ohm's law in electrical circuits (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>).  <ref type="bibr">2002)</ref>.</p><p>Equations 1 to 3 apply to all conducting segments (not leaves blades). Water potential of the upper extremity of the petiole is assumed equal to that of the lumped leaf water potential .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exchange module</head><p>The exchange module computes the rates of net carbon assimilation and transpiration per unit surface area (respectively and ) for each individual leaf as a function of micrometeorological Eq. 5a does not account for stomatal sensitivity to soil water deficit ("remote" approach) or local leaf water potential ("local" approach).  It is noteworthy that only the forced convective heat transfer is currently considered in HydroShoot since forced convection dominates free convection once wind speed exceeds roughly 0.1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Nobel 2005</ref>). This wind speed threshold is generally exceeded during diurnal hours. However, under low wind conditions heat transfer may be underestimated.</p><p>Since the resolution of the last equation is highly time-consuming, we assumed the energy gain from the neighbouring leaves through thermal longwave as a lumped term whereby average leaf temperature is considered instead of individual leaves <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dauzat et al., 2001)</ref>. In this case, the lumped form factor ∑ is simply taken as ( ) (that is the solid angle where neither the sky nor the soil are seen by a single leaf). The former equation becomes:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( [ ( )] ) (Eq. 14) ( )</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Implementation and numerical resolution</head><p>HydroShoot is developed using the Python programming language (Python Software Foundation The resolution of HydroShoot equations is performed by an iterative procedure that is schematized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">2</ref>.  Iterations have three levels. The first is in the hydraulic module and concerns calculating xylem water potential of plant segments in interaction with their hydraulic conductivity (interdependent processes, cf. equations 1 and 2). The second level is between the exchange and hydraulic modules in order to calculate jointly gas-exchanges rates and leaf water potential values (transpiration affects the hydraulic structure Eq. 1 while the latter affects stomatal aperture Eq. 5b). The third level is between the energy module and both exchange and hydraulic modules, so that at each time new   </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model evaluation</head><p>Model evaluation was performed in three steps. Firstly, the coherence between expected and simulated gas-exchange, temperature, and xylem water potential dynamics for different canopy architectures was assessed. Secondly, the precision was assessed by comparing model outputs to measured plant gas-exchange rates and leaf stomatal conductance, water potential and temperature.</p><p>Finally, the required complexity level was evaluated, whereby we sought at determining whether simulating the hydraulic structure and energy balance were (both) required in order to obtain accurate predictions of gas-exchange rates at the plant scale. For all the following simulations, parameter values are given in Appendix IV.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Coherence</head><p>HydroShoot was run on 3 virtual grapevine canopies which share the same soil type, soil initial water content, weather conditions, and total leaf area, and differ only in their shoot architecture (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). The objective was to examine whether the model reflects the differences of shoot architecture on gas and energy exchange rates as may be expected. For instance, whether higher photosynthesis and transpiration rates are obtained for canopies absorbing higher solar irradiance flux densities. Similarly, whether higher transpiration rates trigger steeper drops in leaf water potential.</p><p>The 3 canopies were trained on three different training systems: Vertical Shoot Positioning (VSP), Geneva Double Curtain (GDC) and Lyre systems (Figure <ref type="figure">4a</ref>). All canopies had the same leaf area (5.7 ), internode diameter distribution (Figure <ref type="figure">4b</ref>), planting density (inter-and intra-row spacing of 3.6 and 1.0 respectively), soil type (Sand Loam) and initial collar water potential (-0.6 ).</p><p>The simulations were run using weather data extracted from the database of the weather Data on VSP grapevines (2009) were collected during a period of 4 days under well-watered and water deficit conditions. Water deficit was created by cutting off the irrigation system on the first day of the experiment (July 29 th ). Whole plant transpiration and net assimilation were monitored using open portable gas-exchange chambers (Perez Peña and Tarara, 2004). Temperature of individual leaves were monitored using thermocouples inserted into the primary veins of 10 fully developed individual leaves positioned on different heights from the top of the canopy to the inside, so that temperature gradient resulting from different irradiance conditions was captured.</p><p>Data on GDC grapevines (2012) were also collected during a 4 days experiment (starting on August 1 st ), but only under water deficit conditions. Only rate was monitored by measurements of sap flow installed on the two cordons of the GDC plants. Stomatal conductance and leaf water potential measurements were performed for a number of leaves on GDC grapevines during the experiment, but the exact position of leaves was not reported with measurements.</p><p>For both VSP and GDC grapevines, shoot architecture was constructed based on digitisation data, using a grapevine-specific shoot architecture module following a Multiscale Tree Graph (MTG)</p><p>approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Godin and Caraglio, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Pradal et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Balduzzi et al., 2017)</ref>, in which organs topological connections and geometry were associated to shoot architecture (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">5</ref>). Plant mock-ups were produced so that the simulated vertical and horizontal profiles of leaf surface area fitted those observed.</p><p>A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Complexity</head><p>In order to explore the contribution of HydroShoot's hydraulic and energy modules components to the final simulation output, a sensitivity analysis was performed by plugging/unplugging each of these components and observing the resulting difference on simulated outputs. This procedure aims in fine at evaluating whether adding complexity to an FSPM would improve its performance in predicting gas-exchange dynamics at the plant-scale. The following simulation combinations are used: sim0: the reference (complete) version of HydroShoot having the ensemble of its components;</p><p>sim1: stomatal conductance varies with (as described by Leuning, 1995 in Eq. 5a)</p><p>regardless of leaf water potential; sim2: the hydraulic structure is disregarded (water potential of all leaves is forced equal to water potential at the collar) and stomatal conductance varies with collar water potential Eq. 5c;</p><p>sim3: energy balance is disregarded, that is all leaves have the same temperature as that of the air; sim4: the same case of sim1 but using tighter control of on stomatal conductance ( in Eq. 5a is set to 1 instead of 30 as proposed by Prieto et al.

This trend was reflected on carbon assimilation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6b</ref>), temperature (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6c</ref>), and transpiration (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6d</ref>), whereby highest values were obtained for GDC then Lyre followed by VSP canopies.</p><p>Midday depression in was simulated for the three canopies proportionally to the absorbed irradiance, that is, highest for GDC and lowest for VSP (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">6b</ref>). The higher transpiration rates of GDC led to simulate lower leaf water potential values (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">7</ref>) around midday, which, combined with higher absorbed irradiance, led also to higher leaf temperatures (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">8</ref>). The combined effects of lower leaf water potential and higher temperature in GDC led to simulate a higher effect of midday depression in compared to Lyre and VSP canopies as may be expected.   This first illustrative example on virtual canopies shows that the effect of canopy architecture on its gas-exchange and temperature behaviour is captured in HydroShoot. The comparison to measurements in the following section will show how the observed dynamics on both plant and leaf scales are accurately reproduced using HydroShoot for two real canopies.</p><p>Comparison to observed data</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Leaf-scale</head><p>Simulation results at the leaf-scale are shown in Figures 9, 10 and 11, respectively for water potential, stomatal conductance, and temperature. The dynamics of these variables were adequately reproduced but with some discrepancies regarding the onset timing of the effect of water deficit.</p><p>Figures 9 and 10 show that the simulated and of the three GDC canopies decreased progressively as the soil water deficit increased, consistently with observations, but with an earlier onset of water stress which is probably due to inadequate parametrization either of the response function of to (cf. Eq. 5b) or of the soil hydrodynamic model (cf. Coupling with irradiance and soil models). Upon the onset of water stress, when water deficit was still mild in the first day (date 01 08 in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">10</ref>), HydroShoot simulated higher for sunlit leaves than for shaded leaves. Later, as water deficit increased, this trend was inverted, whereby sunlit leaves had the lowest rates (dates Aug 2 nd and Aug 3 rd in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">10</ref>). This inversion was due to a lower for sunlit leaves as a consequence of higher potential transpiration withdrawal per unit leaf surface area (cf. Eq. 1).</p><p>Moreover, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">10</ref> shows that, by the end of the water deficit period (day Aug 3 rd ), leaf position had merely no more effect on its water vapor conductance . At this stage, water potential of all leaves reached low values at which stomata were almost closed. This uniformization of stomatal closure through the canopy is consistent with the observations reported by Escalona et al.</p><p>( <ref type="bibr">2003,</ref><ref type="bibr">2016)</ref>. Both studies reported a progressive homogenization of gas-exchange rates of grapevine leaves (cv. Tempranillo, Manto Negro and Grenache) as soil water deficit increased. Ngao et al.</p><p>(2017) reported similar results on apple trees (Malus pumila Mill.), showing that intra-canopy variability in decreased significantly under the effect of soil water deficit.  The effect of soil water deficit on leaf temperature was efficiently captured by HydroShoot <ref type="bibr">(Figures 11 and 12)</ref>. The diurnal trends of leaf temperature were adequately reproduced (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">11</ref>) whereby water-deficit leaves (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">11b</ref>, d) had higher temperature than those well-watered (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">11a,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>). The comparison between simulated and observed temperatures at the leaf level (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">12</ref>)</p><p>shows that the model simulated an increase in leaf-to-air temperature of approximately 2 , in agreement with observations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">12a</ref>). Furthermore, HydroShoot reproduced the observed magnitude between minimum and maximum leaf temperatures across the canopy (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">12b</ref>) and how this magnitude increased with soil water deficit (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_19">12c</ref>).</p><p>The overall adequation between simulated and observed leaf temperature was high when comparing median values (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">11</ref>) having an of -0.5 and -0.8 and an of 0.8 and 1.0 under well-watered and water deficit conditions, respectively.

Using the complete combination (sim0) is indeed quite costly in time (between 7 and 12 seconds for each simulation time step, i.e. hour).

(2012) were probably the first to use an FSPM to examine the effects of canopy architecture on gas-exchange in grapevine (cv. Syrah). The authors coupled the grapevine-specific structural plant model proposed by Louarn et al. (2008) to leaf-level models of photosynthesis (Farquhar et al., 1980) and stomatal conductance (Leuning, 1995) but did not incorporate the effects of (soil) water deficit. More recently, Zhu et al. (2017) developed a model similar to that proposed by Prieto et al. (2012) including the effect of water deficit on gas-exchange and leaf temperature. Nevertheless, this model assumed a uniform xylem water potential across the shoot, that disregarded how shoot hydraulic structure affects leaf-scale gas-exchange rates, which is an unrealistic assumption for large plants when considering the substantial hydraulic resistances observed in the stems of mature grapevine (Jacobsen et al., 2012). In addition, longwave energy exchange among leaves from the one hand, and between leaves and the surrounding elements from the other hand, were disregarded, which makes the application of this model to open field conditions not suitable since sky and soil longwave energies substantially affect leaves temperature (Nobel, 2005). This has been solved in two models that link a complete energy budget with gas-exchange in perennials (Bailey et al., 2016 for Vitis vinifera L. and Acer x fremanii; Ngao et al., 2017 for Malus pumila Mill.)

In their study, Bauerle et al. (2007) used leaf temperature as the primer driver for intra-canopy variability in leaf photosynthetic traits. In our study, we linked leaf photosynthetic traits to the 10-days cumulative absorbed (cf. Eq. 12) while leaf temperature was used only to affect directly , and indirectly . This conceptual difference may explain the lower sensitivity to leaf temperature in our study compared to that performed by Bauerle et al. (2007). Bailey et al. (2016) showed furthermore that the importance of accounting for the intra-canopy distribution of leaf temperature inFSPMs is a matter of canopy size. The authors reported that for grapevines, leaf temperature distribution had a negligible impact on the simulated plant-scale emitted thermal longwave irradiance. In contrast, on Freeman maple (Acer × Freemanii) which have notably higher leaf area per plant, simulating the spatial distribution of leaf temperature reduced by 50% prediction errors of the emitted thermal longwave irradiance. The low sensitivity of HydroShoot to leaf temperature may thus be linked to the simulated canopy size.</figDesc></figure>

For instance, increased from 142 to 361 under well-watered conditions, and from 68 to 315 under water deficit conditions, when sim0 is compared to sim1.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusions</head><p>We presented in this paper the functional-structural plant model (FSPM) HydroShoot. This model was built in order to allow simulating the effect of plant shoot architecture on its gas-exchange dynamics under soil water deficit conditions. In order to achieve this objective, we constructed HydroShoot on the base of three interacting processes: leaf-scale gas-exchange, leaf-scale energy balance, and internode-scale xylem transport (i.e. the hydraulic structure of the shoot). The produced model was evaluated using both virtual and real grapevine canopies of three strongly contrasting shoot architectures, under both well-watered and water deficit conditions. We showed that HydroShoot reproduced efficiently the effect of canopy architecture on plant-scale gas-exchange processes under the observed gradient of water deficit conditions, fulfilling thus the objectives for which the model was built. We showed furthermore that both hydraulic structure and energy balance simulations were required for a precise prediction of plant-scale gas-exchange rates under soil water deficit. However, our results indicate that under the given grapevine architecture, soil type, and meteorological conditions, the hydraulic structure has, by far, the largest effect on simulated net photosynthesis and transpiration rates while simulating leaf-scale energy balance improves minorly prediction results.</p><p>A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t</p></div>			</div>
