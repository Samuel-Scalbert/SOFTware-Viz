<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Deep neural networks have achieved enormous success in various language and computer vision tasks, such as multimodal understanding using video-text and image-text data <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Malmaud et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alayrac et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Miech et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Zhukov et al., 2019)</ref>. However, many current systems require a large number of accurate annotations, including image-level labels, location-level labels (bounding boxes and key points), and pixellevel labels.</p><p>A specific type of video data with naturally occurring semi-aligned texts are narrated instructional videos. Such videos are available in large quantities (e.g. on YouTube) and often chosen for learning Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Examples of visual and linguistic ambiguities. Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>) represents the visual ambiguity related to which specific pan (in Figure <ref type="figure">1a</ref>) is referenced with the phrase the pan because many pans occur on the stove.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>) shows the linguistic ambiguity with the use of the pronoun them (in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2b</ref>).</p><p>joint text-video embeddings in multimodal understanding <ref type="bibr">(Zhou et al., 2018b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Miech et al., 2019)</ref>. They often contain a narration explaining the visual content of the corresponding time frames in the video <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Malmaud et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alayrac et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Miech et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Zhukov et al., 2019)</ref>. Instructional videos often contain visual and linguistic ambiguities that can be easily resolved by humans but pose two unique key challenges for automatic text-image processing systems. The first challenge is visual ambiguity, occurring when it is necessary to ground a referring expression in an image with ambiguous visual referents. In Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> (1b), it is not clear from the picture which pan is referred to with the noun phrase the pan without a correct bounding box annotation. The second key challenge is linguistic ambiguity, instantiated for example by the use of anaphoric pronouns <ref type="bibr">(Figure 1,</ref><ref type="bibr">(2b)</ref> or null pronouns (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>).</p><p>In this work, we focus on modeling cases where both ambiguities are intertwined, a phenomenon we refer to as visual-linguistic ambiguity.    1 provides a motivating example: To find which pan in (1b) is denoted by the textual span the pan, we need to find its antecedent in the preceding text. The visual object localization of the textual antecedent the hot pan in (1a) then includes supplementary visual information about the correct pan: The referent is the hot pan with beef in it. In Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, To find the correct location of the object referred to as them in (2b), we first need to find the textual antecedent to understand what them refers to. When identifying pierogi as antecedent, we can use the pierogi for the visual object localization of them.</p><p>An even more complex case is null pronouns (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>): To do object localization and anaphora resolution, the first requirement is the detection of the null pronoun, which then needs to be resolved and located in the image. A located visual object of a null pronoun then assists in finding the textual antecedent, and a resolved null pronoun helps to apply object localization.</p><p>Our guiding idea in this work is that anaphora resolution, the task of connecting linguistic expressions such as the anaphor (i.e., the repeated reference) and its antecedent (i.e., the previous mention in the document). <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Poesio et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Fang et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Oguz et al., 2022)</ref>, and object localization, the task of identifying the location of one or more objects in an image and drawing bounding boxes around their visual space <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Tompson et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Choe et al., 2020)</ref>, can jointly help to resolve visual-linguistic ambiguities. To test this we propose a multitask learning neural model for jointly resolving visual-linguistic ambiguity.</p><p>Our contributions are two-fold: First, we present a new dataset<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> (Section 4), Find2Find, for the joint evaluation of anaphora resolution and object localization based on an extension of Chop&amp;Change <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Oguz et al., 2022)</ref>. Our new data set contains 500 recipes with annotated anaphora and associated object localization. Together with the new data set, we propose the new task of multimodal resolution of Visual-Linguistic Ambiguities. The task provides a unique opportunity for models to fuse text and vision information for solving anaphora resolution and object localization at the same time. Second, we present a new multitask learning system 1 for modeling the two tasks of anaphora resolution and object localization jointly, using a fusion of visual and textual data. Our experiments show that information from each of the tasks mutually benefits performance on the other task. Our idea is based on the fact that in both tasks, the goal is to extract mentions from a given text: what connects object localization and anaphora resolution is that in visual object localization, a corresponding language expression needs to be found, and in anaphora resolution, accurate spans that resolve the anaphoric relations between the anaphor and the antecedents need to be identified.</p></div>

The relations between anaphor and antecedent mostly appear in two different forms: coreference and bridging. Coreference resolution <ref type="bibr">(Clark and Manning, 2016a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Lee et al., 2017)</ref> is the task of finding the linguistic expressions that refer to the same real-world entities in a document, whereas bridging resolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Yu and Poesio, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Kobayashi et al., 2022)</ref> fo-cuses on entities with an associative relation that does not express the same entity but relates to it (e.g., a car and its engine). Most previous work and datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Yu et al., 2022)</ref> tackle coreference resolution and bridging resolution separately.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Object Localization</head><p>Object localization is the task of identifying the location of one or more objects in an image, e.g. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3 (a,</ref><ref type="figure">b,</ref><ref type="figure">c</ref>). Object localization has been studied in computer vision for a long time with various learning methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gokberk Cinbis et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Huang et al., 2018)</ref>. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). MIL <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dietterich et al., 1997</ref>) is a learning strategy that adresses the essence of the incomplete annotation problem, where only coarse-grained labels are available for learning. MIL has been used effectively for weakly-supervised learning in several computer vision works including object tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Babenko et al., 2010)</ref>, object localization <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gokberk Cinbis et al., 2014)</ref>, image classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Wu et al., 2015)</ref>. Huang et al. ( <ref type="formula">2018</ref>) extend MIL reference awareness for visual grounding of instructional videos. We extend MIL for object localization with anaphoric information to avoid the issue of ambiguous language references such as it, them <ref type="bibr">(Zhou et al., 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Huang et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>Weakly Supervised Object Localization The most common way to do object localization is supervised learning, which uses object-level categories with bounding boxes, e.g., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> a. However, for a data-greedy neural learning system, object-level bounding box annotation is timeconsuming and expensive. Weakly supervised object localization approaches avoid this problem and focus on learning object localization with imagelevel object labels (e.g., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref> b) under the MIL paradigm <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Deselaers et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Prest et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Gokberk Cinbis et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Oquab et al., 2015)</ref>.</p><p>Object localization with the MIL approach aims to match object labels with object bounding boxes (e.g., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3 b</ref>). Studies on object localization with image descriptions rather than object labels take weak supervision further <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Karpathy and Fei-Fei, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Huang et al., 2018)</ref>, as in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>  To date, object localization studies have not explored learning from to learn of mention extraction from image descriptions, instead extracting the mentions by using parsing methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kiddon et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Huang et al., 2017</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Huang et al., , 2018) )</ref> or using the predefined mentions list (Zhou et al., 2018a) before the learning process. Thus, we claim object localization and anaphora resolution share a subtask of entity extraction like the mention detection process in anaphora resolution as explained in Section 2.1</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Task</head><p>A recipe consists of instructions I where a cooking instruction I i (e.g. add chopped onions and carrots to the pan) consists of n nominal or null spans and one verbal predicate where n ≥ 1. A span x i of I i might be an incorrect consecutive fragment add chopped or a gold span e, e.g., a noun phrase chopped onions, a pronoun it, or a null pronoun [ϕ] as in mix [ϕ]. Null pronouns are extremely common in recipe instructions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kiddon et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Huang et al., 2017)</ref>. In our approach, we also have a video clip that contains the visual content of the instruction I i with the action and the entities included in the process. Following Zhou et al. (2018a); Huang et al. ( <ref type="formula">2018</ref>), we evenly divide each video clip into three equal parts and randomly sample one image (one frame) V i from each of the three sub-clips to capture the temporal changes of entities. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Anaphora Resolution</head><p>The task of anaphora resolution is to assign each gold span (anaphor) e i where e i ∈ {x i,1 , . . . , x i,1 } of each instruction I i to one or more gold spans (antecedent) y i ∈ {ϵ, I 1 , . . . , I i-1 , e 1,1 , . . . , e i-1,n }, a dummy antecedent ϵ, all preceding instructions I 1 , . . . , I i-1 and all preceding gold spans e 1,1 , . . . , e i-1,n from the previous instructions I 1 , . . . , I i-1 . For a nominal span in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> 1b, the anaphor span the pan refers to the antecedent a hot pan in a previous instruction. For a null pronouns example in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>, the null pronouns ϕ refers to two previous instructions as the antecedents because the null pronoun does not point to any entity and it is also not a new entity for the recipe, it is instead produced by the previous instructions.</p><p>The selection of dummy ϵ as antecedent indicates that the anaphor is an incorrect sequence of consecutive words or a singular entity without an antecedent.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Object Localization</head><p>An image V ∈ R H×W is represented as a bag of ten regions (e.g., the visualization of region proposals of the given positive frame in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>), v h×w 1 , .., v h×w 10 with suitable side lengths of window patches h and w where h &lt; H and w &lt; W . Given a span x i and ten region proposals v h×w 1 , .., v h×w 10 , the task of object localization is to identify whether or not the region proposal belongs to the object of interest, i.e., the text x i when x i is a gold span (e.g., null pronoun [ϕ] or nominal spans) of the corresponding instruction I i . Therefore, the task is to link the text span x i to a corresponding visual region proposal v i where x i is a gold span {e i,1 , . . . , e i,n } of the instruction. We use the dot-product attention between the span x i and the region v i for ranking the visual-semantic matching.   <ref type="formula">2022</ref>) use the YouCookII dataset to propose a multimodal anaphora resolution dataset, Chop&amp;Change, with a novel annotation schema to address the state change of entities in cooking instructions of recipe videos. While the Chop&amp;Change annotation schema captures three anaphoric relations (coreference, near-identity, and bridging), in our work here we concentrate on anaphora resolution ignoring relations and focusing on finding the antecedent. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref> shows that the Chop&amp;Change dataset includes 264 training recipe documents and 89 test documents in total. For our work here, we increase the number of annotated recipes to 400 for train and 100 for test recipes by using the Chop&amp;Change annotation schema. All annotated recipes are associated with respective videos. The structure of annotation is explained with an example in Appendix A.</p><p>Object Localization Data. To construct our test set we examine Huang et al. ( <ref type="formula">2018</ref>) who present a study on reference-aware visual grounding and provide an object localization dataset, FindIt, of 62 YouCookII videos for the given entities in the pro-vided textual descriptions (i.e., instructions). After a deep examination of the FindIt dataset, we find that 30 videos of FindIt could be used with our annotated recipes. Since only 30 videos produce an insufficient test set for the evaluation of object localization, we annotated 70 more videos from the recipes we annotated for anaphora resolution. We extract the frames of the instruction clips by using the temporal boundaries. We obtain 3 video subsets of consecutive frames of the instruction to acquire the state changes of entities in time. We pick one frame with a clear visual content of each entity from the 3 subsets. Thus, each entity is represented in a maximum of three frames for state changes. For evaluation, we annotate the visual object with a bounding box on the selected frames for each entity. In total, we have 5,688 images for 100 recipes annotated for our object localization test set. Note that we do not annotate bounding boxes for the training data as we train our models in a weakly supervised setting.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Methodology</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Model</head><p>In this section, we explain the details of our anaphora resolution and object localization models. Additionally, we formulate the multitask learning approach of joint anaphora resolution and object localization (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>). In order to analyze a given text, it is important to resolve referring expressions. Thus, text-based anaphora resolution is an important method of identifying the antecedent of anaphora. However, here we also have object localization, providing a bounding box for the visual content of language references. The tasks of object localization and anaphora resolution share information via the mention extraction and representation part of the model. Therefore, our mention representations are trained with anaphora resolution and object localization over the mention extraction and representation. The implementation details can be seen in Appendix B.</p><p>As implied in the explanation of both tasks, before resolving references in the previous context or on the image, referring expressions and language references in the text need to be identified, a task known as Mention Extraction. In the next Section, we first describe our approach to representing mentions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1">Mention Extraction and Representation</head><p>We consider all continuous token sequences with up to L words as a potential mention span and compute the corresponding span score. We use SpanBERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Joshi et al., 2020)</ref> as a state-of-art representation for coreference resolution. We capture the linguistic dependencies between anaphor and antecedent in a recipe document by exploiting selfattention: we define SPANBERT(w 1 , . . . , w T ) to be the SpanBERT representation of a recipe, where w 1 is the first token and w T refers to the last token of the recipe. SpanBERT captures the long-range dependencies between the antecedent and anaphor in the recipes. A span x i consists of zero or more tokens of instruction I i . We use the verb as a pointer for null pronouns. For example, mix is the token of the null pronoun ϕ in the instruction mix [ϕ] (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2</ref>). The vector representation g i of a given span x i is obtained by concatenating the contextualized SpanBERT word vectors of its boundary tokens and its width feature:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">g i = [x * START(i) , x * END(i) , ϕ(i)] ϕ(i) = WIDTH(END(i) -START(i)).</formula><p>START(i) and END(i) represent the starting and ending token indexes for g i , respectively. ϕ(i) is the width feature of the span where WIDTH(.) is the embedding function of the predefined bins of <ref type="bibr">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr">3,</ref><ref type="bibr">4,</ref><ref type="bibr">8,</ref><ref type="bibr">16]</ref> as defined by <ref type="bibr">Clark and Manning (2016b)</ref>.</p></div>

However, the references are not always clearly defined. Particularly in a video, the use of pronouns and ellipses are extremely common <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Kiddon et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Huang et al., 2017)</ref>.

We use positive and negative frames where positive frames come from the video clip V i of instruction I i whereas negative frames are drawn from other videos without shared entities. We define pos i to be a region vector set that includes the region proposals v h×w 1 , .., v h×w 10 from the positive image V i , and neg i to contain the region proposals v h×w 1 , .., v h×w 10 from the negative image, e.g., the negative and positive frames in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>.</p><p>The aim of WSOL is to produce a scoring function to maximize the joint probability of positive frame regions v i ∈ pos i and minimize the joint probability of negative regions r i ∈ neg i with the text span x i . We concatenate the mention representation vector g i of span x i and the visual object region vector r i of the region v i to obtain the WSOL input, [g i , r i ], effectively fusing textual and visual information in one input. We then prepare positive (FFNN(g i , r i ) = 1) and negative (FFNN(g i , r i ) = 0) samples to train a model with attention-based deep MIL <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Ilse et al., 2018)</ref>. Positive examples depict exactly the action in question, whereas negative examples correspond to one of four special cases as described below:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">FFNN(gi, ri) =          0 xi = ϵ, ∀ri 0 xi / ∈ {ei,1, . . . , ei,n}, ∀ri 0 xi ∈ {ei,1, . . . , ei,n}, ri ∈ neg i 1 xi ∈ {ei,1, . . . , ei,n}, ri ∈ pos i</formula><p>Our localization model uses the span representation g i that is extracted by the mention extraction and ten positive, i.e., pos i , and ten negatives, i.e., neg i , region representation vectors r i to learn the best region from pos i for the given span g i . Thus, our mention detection model learns the span vector g i also based on the object localization objective (see also Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>). We define the label of FFNN(g i , r i ) as 1 when the span x i is a gold span {e i,1 , . . . , e i,n } and the region vector r i represent the positive regions pos i .</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1">Overview</head><p>We investigate the anaphora resolution and object localization results of gold and candidate spans comparing the F1-scores and Top-1 scores with multitask learning using both tasks and single tasks. Overall, our results in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref> demonstrate that replacing single-task learning with our multitask joint learning approach improves anaphora reso-lution and object localization for both candidate and gold spans. The difference between the results of candidate and gold spans demonstrates that the mention extraction model propagates errors to anaphora resolution and object localization (the sequential structure of model see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">4</ref>). For example, we have the candidate spans such as all n-grams words (bigrams words such as cook the, the bacon, bacon fat) of an instruction cook the bacon fat with the same visual features with bacon and fat in a pan. Thus, an incorrect mention of mention detection directly causes an error in object localization and anaphora resolution.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2">Weakly Supervised Object Localization</head><p>Overall, we observe an improvement in the performance of object localization with multitask learning shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref>. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">2</ref> shows that our joint multitask learning method outperforms DVSA even with candidate mention. Note that DVSA is not the component that is responsible for extracting the mentions for object localization. Thus, we do not analyze object localization for null pronouns and candidate mentions because DVSA ranks the language expression and region pairs and does not apply mention extraction. However, we attached the DVSA method for ranking the gold nominal mentions with the given region proposals.</p><p>The results of object localization with null pronouns clearly demonstrate the benefits of anaphora resolution for object localization. For example, our model localizes the singular mention a jar in <ref type="bibr">Figure 5 (a)</ref>, and the anaphor another piece of bread in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5</ref> (b) better than other methods. Thanks to the mention detection and representation of our multitask learning approach, our object localization model is capable of localization of null pronouns, e.g., Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">5 (c,</ref><ref type="figure">d</ref>) as our model learns to represent the null pronouns in the mention detection process as a mention. Thus, the results of null pronouns  clearly evidence the contribution of anaphora resolution for object localization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.3">Anaphora Resolution</head><p>Multitask learning of anaphora resolution and object localization increases the performance of anaphora resolution. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref> shows &gt; 2% improvements for anaphora resolution with gold mentions and more than 1% for candidate mentions with combined training and testing. When nominal and zero anaphora are investigated separately, the results of nominal anaphora demonstrate an improvement on the results of gold mentions when object localization is included. Additionally, the results of zero anaphora show significant improvements with multitask learning for gold and candidate mentions. Thus, we observe a big part of the improvement for the combined experiments with object localization comes from the zero anaphora resolution samples.</p><p>The benefit of object localization on anaphora resolution is also seen in candidate nominal mentions; it is however not as significant as in gold nominal mentions, as the errors of mention detection for candidate spans directly cause localization as well as anaphora resolution errors.</p><p>The most common error in anaphora resolution is to find the closest antecedent in the entity chain. For example, for tomato-→ it -→ tomato, the first tomato is the antecedent of it, and it is the antecedent of the second tomato. However, the model fails to select the first tomato as the antecedent for the second one.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Conclusion and Future Work</head><p>In this work, we study the problem of visuallinguistic ambiguity in multimodal data and propose the novel task of joint anaphora resolution and object localization. We create the Find2Find dataset for object localization and anaphora resolution with cooking recipes to improve the performance of both tasks by exploiting their commonalities. We implement a model for the joint learning of anaphora resolution and object localization, fusing visual and textual information, and show empirically that a multitask learning paradigm mutually improves both tasks. Especially, the results of zero anaphora resolution indicate that object localization helps to avoid linguistic ambiguity of null pronouns. Our joint multitask learning approach does not apply the temporal features of evolving visual entities even though the temporal features of textual recipes <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Oguz et al., 2022)</ref> are included due to instruction order. In future work, we claim the temporal encoding of visual objects can improve the results of joint anaphora resolution and object localization.  shape the mixture into small patty fry patties in a pan with some oil 1.</p></div>

For example, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6</ref> demonstrates how the onions of the sixth instruction step refers to the onions of the fourth instruction and the onions of the fourth instruction refers to the onions of the third instruction: the onions -→ the onion -→ the onions. Most of the errors of anaphora resolution for recipes occur when the model predicts the onions of the third instruction as the antecedent of the anaphor the onions of the sixth instruction. Additionally, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">6</ref> shows the null pronouns in the eighth instruction and the antecedents such as the fifth, sixth, and seventh instructions.</p></div>
