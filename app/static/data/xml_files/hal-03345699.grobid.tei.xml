<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Knowledge graph embeddings are popular latent representations of knowledge graphs (KG). In the search for KG embeddings that could capture ontological knowledge (i.e., schema of KG), geometric models of existential rules have been recently introduced <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Such models have several advantages. Notably, they ensure that facts which are valid in the embedding are logically consistent and deductively closed w.r.t. the ontology, and they can also be used to find plausible missing ontology rules. It has been shown that convex geometric regions capture the so-called quasi-chained rules, a fragment of first-order Horn logic. Attributed description logics (DL) have been defined to bridge the gap between DL ontology languages and KG, whose facts often come with various kinds of annotations that may need to be taken into account for reasoning. In particular, they were introduced as a formalism for dealing with the meta-knowledge present in KG, such as temporal validity, provenance, language, and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>. As time is of primary interest in KG, attributed DLs have been enriched with temporal attributes, whose semantics allows for some temporal reasoning over discrete time <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Considering that geometric models and (temporally) attributed DLs are promising tools designed for KG, this paper investigates their compatibility, focusing on the attributed version of a Horn dialect of the DL-Lite family.</p><p>Our contributions are as follows:</p><p>-We adapt the notion of geometric models for ((temporally) attributed) DLs; in particular, we use an arbitrary linear map to combine the individual geometric interpretations instead of restricting ourselves to vector concatenation, and define satisfaction of concept or role inclusions directly based on geometric inclusion relationship between the regions that interpret the concepts or roles. -We show that every satisfiable attributed DL-Lite H horn ontology has a convex geometric model but there are satisfiable temporally attributed DL-Lite H horn ontologies without such a model.</p><p>-We exhibit restrictions on the use of temporal attributes that guarantee that temporally attributed DL-Lite H horn ontologies have a convex geometric model.</p><p>We define attributed DLs and geometric models in Section 2. Then, in Section 3, we study the relationship between satisfiability and the existence of convex geometric models in DL-Lite H horn . We then extend our analysis for temporally attributed DL-Lite H horn in Section 4. In Section 5, we discuss related works and we conclude in Section 6. Omitted proofs are given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Geometric Models for Attributed Description Logics</head><p>In this section, we recall the framework of attributed DLs and define geometric models in this context.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Attributed DLs</head><p>We introduce attributed DLs by defining attributed DL-Lite <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, focusing on the DL-Lite H horn dialect. The notions presented here can be easily adapted to other attributed DLs, e.g. EL, as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>. Let N C , N R , and N I be countably infinite and mutually disjoint sets of concept, role, and individual names. We assume that N I is divided into two sets, called N i and N a , and we refer to the elements in N a as annotation names. We consider an additional set N U of set variables and a set N V of object variables. The set S of specifiers contains the following expressions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">-set variables X ∈ N U ; -closed specifiers [a 1 : v 1 , . . . , a n : v n ]; and -open specifiers a 1 : v 1 , . . . , a n : v n ,</formula><p>where a i ∈ N a and v i is either an individual name in N a , an object variable in N V , or an expression of the form X.a, with X a set variable in N U and a an individual name in N a . We use X.a to refer to the (finite, possibly empty) set of all values of attribute a in an annotation set X. A ground specifier is a closed or open specifier built only over N a .</p><p>Syntax. A DL-Lite H,@ horn concept (resp. role) assertion is an expression A(a)@S (resp. R(a, b)@S), with A ∈ N C (resp. R ∈ N R ), a, b ∈ N i , and S ∈ S a ground closed specifier. A DL-Lite H,@ horn role inclusion is an expression of the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">X : S (P Q),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where S ∈ S is a closed or open specifier, X ∈ N U is a set variable, and P, Q are role expressions built according to the following syntax:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P := R@S | R -@S, Q := P | ¬P<label>(2)</label></formula><p>with S ∈ S, R ∈ N R . A DL-Lite H,@ horn concept inclusion is of the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">X 1 : S 1 , . . . , X n : S n ( k i=1 B i C),<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where k, n ≥ 1, S 1 , . . . , S n ∈ S are closed or open specifiers, X 1 , . . . , X n ∈ N U are set variables, and B i , C are concept expressions built according to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">B := A@S | ∃P, C := B | ⊥,<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where P is as in Equation (2), A ∈ N C and S ∈ S. Role expressions of the form P are called roles and concept expression of the form B are basic concepts. We further require that all object variables are safe, that is, if they occur on the right side of a concept/role inclusion or in a specifier associated with a set variable occurring on the right side then they must also occur on the left side of the inclusion (or in a specifier associated with a set variable occurring on the left).</p><p>A DL-Lite H,@ horn ontology is a set of DL-Lite H,@ horn assertions, role and concept inclusions. We say that an inclusion is positive if it does not contain negation or ⊥. Also, we say that a DL-Lite H,@ horn ontology is ground if it does not contain variables. To simplify notation, we omit the specifier (meaning "any annotation set") in role or concept expressions. In this sense, any DL-Lite H horn axiom is also a DL-Lite H,@ horn axiom. Moreover, we omit prefixes of the form X : , which state that there is no restriction on X.</p><p>Semantics. An interpretation I = (∆ I i , ∆ I a , • I ) of an attributed DL consists of a non-empty domain ∆ I i of individuals, a non-empty domain ∆ I a of annotations, and a function • I . Individual names a ∈ N i are interpreted as elements a I ∈ ∆ I i and individual names a ∈ N a are interpreted as elements a I ∈ ∆ I a . To interpret annotation sets, we use the set</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">Φ I := {Σ ⊆ ∆ I a × ∆ I a | Σ is finite} of all finite binary relations over ∆ I a . Each concept name A ∈ N C is interpreted</formula><p>as a set A I ⊆ ∆ I i × Φ I of elements with annotations, and each role name R ∈ N R is interpreted as a set R I ⊆ ∆ I i × ∆ I i × Φ I of pairs of elements with annotations. Each element (pair of elements) may appear with multiple different annotations. I satisfies a concept assertion A(a)@[a 1 : v 1 , . . . , a n : v n ] if (a I , {(a I 1 , v I 1 ), . . . , (a I n , v I n )}) ∈ A I . Role assertions are interpreted analogously. Expressions with free set or object variables are interpreted using variable assignments Z mapping object variables x ∈ N V to elements Z(x) ∈ ∆ I a and set variables X ∈ N U to finite binary relations Z(X) ∈ Φ I . For convenience, we also extend variable assignments to individual names, setting Z(a) = a I for every a ∈ N a . A specifier S ∈ S is interpreted as a set S I,Z ⊆ Φ I of matching annotation sets. We set X I,Z := {Z(X)} for variables X ∈ N U . The semantics of closed specifiers is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">-[a: v] I,Z := {{(a I , Z(v))}} where v ∈ N a ∪ N V ; -[a: X.b] I,Z := {{(a I , δ) | (b I , δ) ∈ Z(X)}}; -[a 1 : v 1 , . . . , a n : v n ] I,Z := { n i=1 F i } where {F i } = [a i : v i ] I,Z for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. S I,Z</formula><p>therefore is a singleton set for variables and closed specifiers. For open specifiers, however, we define a 1 : v 1 , . . . , a n : v n I,Z to be the set:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">{F ⊆ Φ I | F ⊇ G for {G} = [a 1 : v 1 , . . . , a n : v n ] I,Z }. Now given A ∈ N C , R ∈ N R</formula><p>, and S ∈ S, we define:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">(A@S) I,Z := {δ | (δ, F ) ∈ A I for some F ∈ S I,Z }, (R@S) I,Z := {(δ, ) | (δ, , F ) ∈ R I for some F ∈ S I,Z }.</formula><p>Further DL expressions are defined as: (R -@S) I,Z := {(γ, δ) | (δ, γ) ∈ (R@S) I,Z }, ¬P I,Z := (∆ I i ×∆ I i )\P I,Z , ∃P I,Z := {δ | there is (δ, )</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">∈ P I,Z }, (B 1 B 2 ) I,Z := B I,Z 1 ∩ B I,Z</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2</head><p>, ⊥ I,Z := ∅. I satisfies a concept inclusion of the form (3) if, for all variable assignments Z that satisfy Z(X i ) ∈ S I,Z i for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, we have ( k i=1 B i ) I,Z ⊆ C I,Z . Satisfaction of role inclusions is defined analogously. An interpretation I satisfies an ontology O, or is a model of O, if it satisfies all of its axioms. As usual, |= denotes the induced logical entailment relation.</p><p>For ground specifiers {S, T } ⊆ S, we write S ⇒ T if T is an open specifier, and the set of attribute-value pairs a : b in S is a superset of the set of attribute-value pairs in T .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Geometric Models</head><p>We now define the geometric interpretations of attributed relations. Let m be an integer and f : R m × R m → R 2•m be a fixed but arbitrary linear map satisfying the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">(i) the restriction of f to R m × {0} m is injective; (ii) the restriction of f to {0} m × R m is injective; (iii) f (R m × {0} m ) ∩ f ({0} m × R m ) = {0 2•m };</formula><p>where 0 m denotes the vector (0, . . . , 0) with m zeros. Intuitively, individuals will be interpreted as vectors from R m and f will be used to combine two vectors to interpret pairs of individuals.</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">Definition 1 (Geometric Interpretation). An m-dimensional f -geometric interpretation η of (N C , N R , N i , N a ) assigns -to each A ∈ N C and ground S ∈ S a region η(A@S) ⊆ R m , -to each R ∈ N R and ground S ∈ S a region η(R@S) ⊆ R 2•m , and -to each a ∈ N i a vector η(a) ∈ R m . Moreover, for all {S, T } ⊆ S and E ∈ N C ∪ N R , if S ⇒ T then η(E@S) ⊆ η(E@T ). We say that η is convex if, for every E ∈ N C ∪ N R , every ground S ∈ S, every v 1 , v 2 ∈ η(E@S), and every λ ∈ [0, 1], if v 1 , v 2 ∈ η(E@S) then (1 -λ)v 1 + λv 2 ∈ η(E@S).</formula><p>The interpretation of ground complex concept or role expressions is as follows.

The interest of geometric interpretations is that concept and role assertions translate into membership in geometric regions and ground concept or role inclusions translate into geometric inclusions.</p></div>

This result follows from the fact that there is an isomorphism between the regions in η and η .</p><p>To define when a geometric interpretation is a model of a (possibly not ground) DL-Lite H,@ horn ontology, we need to define when such an interpretation satisfies non-ground concept or role inclusions. To do so, we use a standard interpretation built from the geometric interpretation. Given a ground specifier S and an annotation name , we define</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">F S = {(a, b) | a: b occurs in S} ∪ {( , ) | if S is open}.

Then, the following holds: η |= α iff I(η, D ) |= α.</p><p>Proof (Sketch). The proof relies heavily on the definition of F S and the requirement that η(E@S) ⊆ η(E@T ) when S ⇒ T in Definition 1.</p><p>We are now ready to define geometric models of DL-Lite H,@ horn ontologies.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Satisfiability and Convex Geometric Models</head><p>We start by recalling some definitions and results on geometric interpretations of an ontology containing existential rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. An existential rule is an expression of the form B 1 ∧ • • • ∧ B n → ∃X 1 , . . . , X j .H where n ≥ 0, the B i 's and H are atoms built from sets of predicates, constants and variables, and the X i 's are variables.</p><p>A negative constraint is a rule whose head is ⊥. An existential rule or negative constraint is quasi-chained if for all 1</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">≤ i ≤ n, |(vars(B 1 ) ∪ • • • ∪ vars(B i-1 )) ∩ vars(B i )| ≤ 1</formula><p>, where vars(B) denotes the variables that occur in B. It is easy to see that a DL-Lite H horn ontology without negative role inclusions can be translated into a quasi-chained ontology. Negative role inclusions are not quasi-chained: their translation to rules is indeed of the form P 1 (x, y) ∧ P 2 (x, y) → ⊥ where the body atoms share two variables. A (standard) model M of an existential rules ontology K is a set of facts that contains all facts from K and satisfies all existential rules from K. In this setting, for every fact α, α ∈ M iff M |= α.</p><p>Given a set R of relation names and a set X of constants and labelled nulls, a m-dimensional geometric interpretation η of (R, X) assigns to each k-ary relation R from R a region η(R) ⊆ R k.m and to each object o from X a vector η(o) ∈ R m . Tuples of individuals are interpreted using vectors concatenation, which plays the role of the linear map f we use to interpret a pair of individuals: for every</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">R ∈ R and o 1 , . . . , o k ∈ X, η |= R(o 1 , . . . , o k ) if η(o 1 ) ⊕ • • • ⊕ η(o k ) ∈ η(R). The authors define Φ(η) = {R(o 1 , . . . , o k ) | R ∈ R, o 1 , . . . , o k ∈ X, η |= R(o 1 , . . . , o k )}.</formula><p>Proposition 3 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> states that if K is a quasi-chained ontology and M is a finite model of K, then K has a convex geometric model η such that Φ(η) = M. This transfers to the DL setting as follows. Let O be a quasi-chained DL ontology and J be a finite model of O such that ∆ J = N i , and a J = a for every a ∈ N i (which implies that for every concept A, if δ ∈ A J , then J |= A(δ), and similarly for roles). Then O has a convex geometric model η such that</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">{E(t) | η |= E(t)} = {E(t) | J |= E(t)},</formula><p>where E ∈ N C ∪ N R and t is a tuple with the arity of E. In the following, we may similarly write E(t)@S to refer to an atom of the form A(a)@S or R(a, b)@S. Theorem 6. Let O be a satisfiable DL-Lite H,@ horn ontology without negative role inclusions. O has a convex geometric model. Proof (Sketch). We use grounding to translate O into an equisatisfiable DL-Lite H horn ontology. Since O does not contain negative role inclusion, the obtained DL-Lite H horn ontology is quasi-chained. We can thus apply the result by Gutiérrez-Basulto and Schockaert <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> to get a convex m-dimensional f -geometric model with f being vector concatenation. This geometric model is used to construct a geometric model of O.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>We introduce temporally attributed DLs by defining temporally attributed DL-Lite H</head><p>horn , called DL-Lite H,T,@ horn , as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. The description logic DL-Lite H,T,@ horn is defined as a multi-sorted version of DL-Lite H,@ horn , where time points and intervals are seen as datatypes. Time points are elements of N T , and time intervals are elements of N 2 T . These sets and the set of (abstract) individual names N I are mutually disjoint. Time points are represented in a discrete manner by natural numbers, and we assume that elements of N T (N 2 T ) are (pairs of) numbers. A pair of numbers k, in N 2 T is denoted [k, ]. The annotation names: time, before, after, until, since, during, between ∈ N a are called temporal attributes and have their own semantics. Basically, time is used to mark a point in time and before and after refer to some point in the past and in the future, respectively. The temporal attributes until and since refer to all points in the past and all point in the future (e.g. since 2020 the KR conference became an annual event). Finally, during is an interval which represents a period of time (it refers to all points in the interval) and between is an interval of uncertainty for when an event happened. The value type of time, before, after, until, since is N T , while the value type of during, between is N 2 T . We write valtype(a) to refer to the value type of the annotation name a. Object variables are now taken from pairwise disjoint sets Var(N a ), Var(N T ), and Var(N 2 T ). Annotation set specifiers are defined as in Section 2.1 with the difference that for each a i ∈ N a and each v i in attribute value pair a i : v i we require compatibility between the value type of its attribute, that is: </p><formula xml:id="formula_21">-v i ∈ valtype(a i ) ∪ Var(valtype(a i )), or -v i = [v, w] with valtype(a i ) = N 2 T and v, w in N T ∪ Var(N T ), or -v i = X.b with X ∈ N U , b ∈ N a ,</formula><formula xml:id="formula_22">[t, t ] ∈ N 2 T as [t, t ] I = (t I , t I ) ∈ ∆ I 2T .

Definition 9 (Geometric Model). Let O be a DL-Lite H,T,@ horn ontology. An f -geometric interpretation η is an m-dimensional f -geometric model of O if it is global for a sequence (η j ) j∈∆ T of m-dimensional f -geometric interpretations and N O , plus I(η, N O ) satisfies O.</formula><p>Example 10 shows that even if temporal specifiers are only of the form time and during, convex geometric models may not exist for satisfiable DL-Lite H,T,@ horn ontologies.</p><formula xml:id="formula_29">Example 10.

It follows that I(η, N O ) |= R(δ, δ)@[during: [1, 2]]. Since I(η, N O ) |= R@[during: [1, 2]] A, we also have that I(η, N O ) |= A(δ). Hence I(η, N O ) |= ∃R@[time: 1] A ⊥. This means that I(η, N O ) is not a model of O.</formula><p>To overcome this problem, we introduce a restriction on the specifiers allowed on roles. We introduce atemporal specifiers.

The need of Condition (i) is already illustrated by Example 10 whereas Condition (ii) ensures that the underlying logic is Horn (that is, it does not have disjunctions which can be expressed with the temporal attributes before, after and between).</p><p>Theorem 12. Let O be a satisfiable DL-Lite H,T,@ horn ontology without negative role inclusions and such that (i) all specifiers attached to a role in O are atemporal, and (ii) before, after and between do not occur in O. Then O has a convex geometric model.</p><p>Traditionally, most KG embedding models are time-unaware. These models embed both entities and relations in a low-dimensional latent space based on some regularities of target KG. They can be used as approximate reasoning methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> for completing KG without using the schema. Typical embedding models include the translation based models, such as TransE <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and bilinear models, such as ComplEx <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and SimplE <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. From the expressiveness perspective, TransE and DisMult have been shown to be not fully expressive; however, CompleEx and SimplE are fully expressive. Gutierrez-Basulto and Schockaert <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> use geometric models to study the compatibility between TBox/ontology and KG embeddings. They show that bilinear models (inc. ComplEx and SimplE) cannot strictly represent relation subsumption rules. Wiharja et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> show that many well known KG embeddings based on KG completion methods are not impressive, when schema aware correctness is considered, despite good performance reported in silver standard based evaluations. Currently, more and more applications are involving dynamic KG, where knowledge in practice is time-variant and consists of sequences of observations. For example, in recommendation systems based on KG, new items and new user actions appear in real time. Accordingly, temporal KG embedding models incorporate time information into their node and relation representations. We next discuss how temporal information is taken into account in KG embeddings and how it has been used in combination with classical DLs.</p><p>Temporal Knowledge Graph Embeddings. Temporal KG embedding models can be seen as extensions of static KG embedding models. A basic approach is to collapse the dynamic graph into a static graph by aggregating the temporal observations over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. This approach, however, may lose large amounts of information. An alternative approach is to give more weights to snapshots that are more recent <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Another alternative approach to aggregating temporal observations is to apply decomposition methods to dynamic graphs. The idea is to model a KG as an order 4 tensor and decompose it using CP or Tucker, or other decomposition methods to obtain entity, relation, and timestamp embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. In addition to aggregation based approaches, there are approaches extending static KG embedding, such as TransE, by adding a timestamp embedding into the score function <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>. Jiang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> only use such timestamps to maintain temporal order, while using Integer Linear Programming to encode the temporal consistency information as constraints. Ma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> extend several models (Tucker, RESCAL, HolE, ComplEx, DistMult) by adding a timestamp embedding to their score functions. These models may not work well when the number of timestamps is large. Furthermore, since they only learn embeddings for observed timestamps, they cannot generalize to unseen timestamps. Dasgupta et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> fragments a temporally-scoped input KG into multiple static subgraphs with each subgraph corresponding to a timestamp. There are also approaches of applying random walk models for temporal KG. E.g., Bian et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> use metapath2vec to generate random walks on both the initial KG and the updated nodes and re-compute the embeddings for these nodes. These approaches mainly leverage the temporal aspect of dynamic graphs to reduce the computations. However, they may fail at capturing the evolution and the temporal patterns of the nodes. Another natural choice for modeling temporal KG is by extending sequence models to graph data. E.g., García-Duran <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> extend TransE and DistMult by combining the relation and timestamp through a character LSTM, so as to learn representations for time-augmented KG facts that can be used in conjunction with existing scoring functions for link prediction. Ma et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> argue that temporal KG embeddings could also be used as models for cognitive episodic memory (facts we remember and can recollect) and for semantic memory (current facts we know) can be generated from episodic memory by a marginalization operation.</p><p>Temporal Description Logics. In the DL literature, there are several approaches for representing and reasoning temporal information <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>. Schmiedel <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> was the first to propose an extension of the description logics (the FLEN R - DL in this case) with an interval-based temporal logic, with the temporal quantifier at, the existential and universal temporal quantifiers sometime and alltime. Artale and Franconi <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref> considered a class of interval-based temporal description logics by reducing the expressivity to keep the property of decidability of the logic proposed by Schmiedel <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Schild proposed ALCT <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, extending ALC with point-based modal temporal connectives from tense logic <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, including existential future (♦), universal future ( ), next instant ( ),until (U), reflexive until (U). Wolter and Zakharyaschev studied the ALC - M DL and showed that it is decidable in the class of linear, discrete and unbounded temporal structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>. They also showed that the ALC M DL (extending the ALC - M DL with global roles) is undecidable <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>. Temporal operators can be used in a temporal ABox as well, allowing the use of next instant ( ϕ) and until (ϕUψ) with ABox assertions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Ozaki et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> propose temporally attributed DLs, which allows the use of absolute temporal information in both TBoxes and ABoxes. They show that the satisfiability of ground ELH T @ ontologies is ExpTime-complete, and that the satisfiability of ground ELH T @ ontologies without the temporal attributes between, before and after is PTime-complete.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We investigate how geometric models can (or cannot) be used to capture rules about annotated data expressed in the formalism of attributed DLs. We show that every satisfiable attributed DL-Lite H horn ontology has a convex geometric model and that this is also the case when allowing the use of temporal attributes under some restrictions. There is still a long way to make this result practical since we still require an embedding technique that would construct such a model. In this direction, we highlight the work of Abboud et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, where relations are mapped to convex regions in the format of hyper-rectangles.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>and valtype(a i ) = valtype(b).
