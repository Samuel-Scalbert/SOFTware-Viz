			<abstract>
<div><p>Using knowledge graph embedding models (<software>KGEMs</software>) is a popular approach for predicting links in knowledge graphs (KGs). Traditionally, the performance of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> for link prediction is assessed using rank-based metrics, which evaluate their ability to give high scores to ground-truth entities. However, the literature claims that the <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> evaluation procedure would benefit from adding supplementary dimensions to assess. That is why, in this paper, we extend our previously introduced metric Sem@K that measures the capability of models to predict valid entities w.r.t. domain and range constraints. In particular, we consider a broad range of KGs and take their respective characteristics into account to propose different versions of Sem@K. We also perform an extensive study to qualify the abilities of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> as measured by our metric. Our experiments show that Sem@K provides a new perspective on <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> quality. Its joint analysis with rank-based metrics offers different conclusions on the predictive power of models. Regarding Sem@K, some <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> are inherently better than others, but this semantic superiority is not indicative of their performance w.r.t. rank-based metrics. In this work, we generalize conclusions about the relative performance of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> w.r.t. rank-based and semantic-oriented metrics at the level of families of models. The joint analysis of the aforementioned metrics gives more insight into the peculiarities of each model. This work paves the way for a more comprehensive evaluation of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> adequacy for specific downstream tasks.</p></div>

<div><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>A knowledge graph (KG) is commonly seen as a directed multi-relational graph in which two nodes can be linked through potentially several semantic relationships. More formally, a knowledge graph KG = (E, R, T ) where E, R and T ⊆ E × R × E are a set of entities (nodes), relations (edge labels) and triples, respectively. A KG is represented as a collection of such triples -a.k.a. facts -denoted as (h, r, t) ∈ T where h ∈ E and t ∈ E are two entities of the graph and are respectively named the head and tail of the triple, while r ∈ R is a predicate that qualifies the nature of the relationship holding between these entities. For instance, in the sample KG depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>: E = {BarackObama,MichelleObama,EmmanuelMacron,USA,France} and R = {spouseOf,presidentOf,supports,livesIn}.</p><p>KGs are inherently incomplete, incorrect, or overlapping and thus major refinement tasks include entity matching, question answering, and link prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Paulheim [2017]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Wang et al. [2017]</ref>. The latter is the focus of this paper. Link prediction (LP) aims at completing KGs by leveraging existing facts to infer missing ones. In the LP task, one is provided with a set of incomplete triples, where the missing head (resp. tail) needs to be predicted. This amounts to holding a set of triples T ′ where, for each triple, either the head h or the tail t is missing. This task can be subdivided into a head prediction phase -which consists in predicting the most plausible head h for each (?, r, t) -and a tail prediction phase -which consists in predicting the most plausible tail t for each (h, r, ?). In the sample KG depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, an example of triple to be predicted during the tail prediction phase would be (EmmanuelMacron,livesIn,?), where the expected tail to be inferred is France. Training a Knowledge Graph Embedding Model (<software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software>) firstly requires corrupting existing triples by replacing either their head h or their tail t with another entity to generate negative counterparts. This procedure is called negative sampling <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bordes et al. [2013]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Krompaß et al. [2015]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Jain et al. [2021a]</ref>.</p><p>Secondly, the <software>KGEM</software> iteratively learns to assign higher scores to true triples than to their negative counterparts.</p><p>The performance of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> for LP is evaluated using rank-based metrics such as Hits@K, Mean Rank (MR), and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) that assess whether ground-truth entities are indeed given higher scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Wang et al. [2017]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Rossi et al. [2021]</ref>. However, various works recently raised some caveats about such metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Berrendorf et al. [2020]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hoyt et al. [2022]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Tiwari et al. [2021]</ref>. For instance, they are not well-suited for drawing comparisons across datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Berrendorf et al. [2020]</ref>. More importantly, they only provide a partial picture of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Berrendorf et al. [2020]</ref>. Indeed, LP can lead to nonsensical triples, such as (BarackObama,isFatherOf,USA), being predicted as highly plausible facts, although they violate constraints on the domain and range of relations <ref type="bibr">Jain et al. [2021a]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Wang et al. [2019]</ref>. <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> with such issues may nevertheless reach a satisfying performance in terms of rank-based metrics.</p><p>Few works propose to go beyond the mere traditional quantitative performance of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> and address their ability to capture the semantics of the original KG, e.g., domain and range constraints, hierarchy of classes <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Paulheim [2018]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Jain et al. [2021b]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Monnin et al. [2022]</ref>. According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Berrendorf et al. Berrendorf et al. [2020]</ref>, this would give a more complete picture of the performance of a <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software>. This is why we advocate for additional qualitative and semantic-oriented metrics to supplement traditional rank-based metrics and propose Sem@K to address this need. The relevance of using semantic-oriented metrics -more specifically Sem@K -is clearly visible in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>: Sem@K provides a supplementary dimension to the evaluation procedure and allows to confidently choose between two models. They are equally good in terms of rank-based metrics but Model A predicts entities that are semantically valid w.r.t. the range constraint.</p><p>More specifically, in this work, our goal is to assess the ability of popular <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> to capture the semantic profile of relations in a LP task, i.e., whether <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> predict entities that respects domain and range of relations. Henceforth, we refer to this aspect as the semantic awareness of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software>. To do so, we build on Sem@K, a semantic-oriented metric that we previously introduced <ref type="bibr">Hubert et al. [2022a,b]</ref> In <ref type="bibr">Hubert et al. [2022a]</ref>, Sem@K was specifically defined for the recommendation task which was seen as predicting tails for a unique target relation. Sem@K was then extended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hubert et al. [2022b]</ref> to the more generic LP task, where not only tails but also heads are corrupted and all relations are considered. In the present work, we deepen the study of the semantic awareness of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> by proposing different versions of Sem@K that take into account the different characteristics of KGs (e.g., hierarchy of types). Moreover, the semantic awareness of a wider range of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> is analyzed -especially convolutional models. Likewise, a broader array of KGs is used, in order to benchmark the semantic capabilities of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> on mainstream LP datasets. Thus, the following research questions are addressed:</p><p>• RQ1: how semantic-aware agnostic <software>KGEMs</software> are?</p><p>• RQ2: how the evaluation of <software>KGEM</software> semantic awareness should adapt to the typology of KGs?</p><p>• RQ3: does the evaluation of <software>KGEM</software> semantic awareness offer different conclusions on the relative superiority of some <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> compared to rank-based metrics?</p><p>Accordingly, the main contributions of this work are:</p><p>• to evaluate <software>KGEM</software> semantic awareness on any kind of KG, we extend a previously defined semantic-oriented metric and tailor it to support a broader range of KGs. • we perform an extensive study of the semantic awareness of state-of-the-art <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> on mainstream KGs. We show that most of the observed trends apply at the level of families of models. • we perform a dynamic study of the evolution of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> semantic awareness vs. their performance in terms of rank-based metrics along training epochs. We show that a trade-off may exist for most <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software>. • our study supports the view that agnostic <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> are quickly able to infer the semantics of KG entities and relations.</p><p>The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Related work is presented in Section 2. Section 3 outlines the main motivations for assessing the semantic awareness of <software>KGEMs</software>. Section 4 subsequently presents Sem@K, the semantic-oriented metric that fulfills this purpose. Sem@K comes in different flavors based on the typology of the datasets at hand and the intended use cases. In Section 5, we detail the datasets and <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> used in this work, before presenting the experimental findings in Section 6. A thorough discussion is provided in Section 7. Lastly, Section 8 outlines future research directions.</p><p>2 Related work 2.1 Link prediction using knowledge graph embedding models Several LP approaches have been proposed to complete KGs. Symbolic approaches relying on rule-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Galárraga et al. [2013</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Galárraga et al.

[2018]</ref> are somewhat popular but are not considered in the present work. Instead, <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> are the focus of this paper.</p><p>In particular, this work is concerned with assessing the semantic awareness of agnostic <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software>. The semantic awareness of such models is defined as their ability to score higher entities whose types belong to the domain and range of relations. Agnostic <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> are defined as <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> that rely solely on the structure of the KG to learn entity and relation representations. In this respect, these models differ according to several criteria, such as the nature of the embedding space or the type of scoring function <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Wang et al. [2017</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al. [ , 2021a]]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ji et al. [2022]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Rossi et al. [2021]</ref>. In this work, <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> are considered with respect to three main families of models that are traditionally distinguished in the literature.</p><p>Geometric models are additive models that consider relations as geometric operations in the latent embedding space. A head entity h is spatially transformed using an operation τ that depends on the relation embedding r. Then the distance between the resulting vector and the tail entity t is used as a measure for assessing the plausibility of a fact (h, r, t).</p><p>A distance-based function δ is used to define the scoring function f of such <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software>: f (h, r, t) = δ(τ (h, r), t). A large array of geometric models is purely translational and is based on <software ContextAttributes="used">TransE</software> <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bordes et al. [2013]</ref> and its extensions. <software ContextAttributes="used">TransE</software> was the earliest introduced geometric model for link prediction. It enforces the sum of the head and relation embeddings to lie in a close neighborhood of the tail embedding. The distance-based function δ is usually the L1 or L2 norm. <software ContextAttributes="used">TransE</software> does not properly handle 1-to-N, N-to-1, nor N-to-N relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Wang et al. [2017]</ref> and yet has been found to be very efficient in multi-relational settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Chowdhury et al. [2019]</ref>. A myriad of translational models have been proposed since then, such as TransH <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Wang et al. [2014]</ref>, TransR <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Lin et al. [2015]</ref>, TransD <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Ji et al. [2015]</ref>, TransA <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Jia et al. [2016] and</ref><ref type="bibr">TransG Xiao et al. [2016]</ref>. In addition to these purely translational models, some recent geometric models either replace or combine the translation operation with rotation-wise transformations to make their models even more expressive and deal with difficult relational patterns such as symmetric or anti-symmetric relations. A case in point is <software ContextAttributes="used">RotatE</software> <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Sun et al. [2019]</ref>, which considers relations as rotations in a complex latent space. h, r and t are all embedded in C d where d denotes the embeddings' dimension. The use of the rotation operation allows <software ContextAttributes="used">RotatE</software> to properly address many relational patterns. In particular, <software ContextAttributes="used">RotatE</software> is able to take account for symmetry -which is not modeled correctly by <software ContextAttributes="used">TransE</software>. In the wake of <software ContextAttributes="used">RotatE</software>, a handful of other roto-translational models have subsequently been proposed in the literature, e.g. QuatE <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Zhang et al. [2019]</ref>, DualE <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Cao et al. [2021]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">HAKE Zhang et al. [2020a]</ref>.</p><p>Semantic matching models are named this way as they usually use a similarity-based function to define their own scoring function. Semantic matching models are also referred to as matrix factorization models or tensor decomposition models, in the sense that a KG can be seen as a 3D adjacency matrix, in other words a three-way tensor. This tensor can be decomposed into a set of low-dimensional vectors that actually represent the entity and relation embeddings.</p><p>Semantic matching models are subdivided into bilinear and non-bilinear models. Bilinear models share the characteristic of capturing interactions between two entity vectors using multiplicative terms. <ref type="bibr">RESCAL Nickel et al. [2011]</ref> is the earliest introduced bilinear model for LP. It models entities as vectors and relations as matrices. The components w i,j of the relation matrix W r ∈ R d×d account for the interaction intensity between the i-th embedding component of e h ∈ R d and the j-th embedding component of e t ∈ R d under the relation r. As pointed out by the original author of RESCAL <ref type="bibr">Nickel et al. [2016a]</ref>, the parameter complexity of this model can drastically increase when the embedding dimension is large. <software ContextAttributes="used">DistMult</software> <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Yang et al. [2015]</ref> alleviates this scalability issue by enforcing all relation-matrices W r to be diagonal. Doing so, <software ContextAttributes="used">DistMult</software> trades computational advantages for less expresiveness. Indeed, <software ContextAttributes="used">DistMult</software> is not able to model anti-symmetric relations. However, <software ContextAttributes="used">DistMult</software> still achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kadlec et al. [2017]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">ComplEx Trouillon et al. [2016]</ref> relies on complex-valued representations for both entities and relations.</p><p>Because the Hadamard product is used in the scoring function, ComplEx is not commutative in the complex space and can properly model anti-symmetric relations. Other bilinear models with distinctive features were later proposed, such as Analogy <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Liu et al. [2017]</ref>, <software ContextAttributes="used">SimplE</software> Kazemi and Poole <ref type="bibr">[2018]</ref> and DihEdral <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Xu and Li [2019]</ref> that are supposedly more expressive models. Another category of semantic matching models leverage interactions between entities and relations using non-bilinear operations. For instance, HolE <ref type="bibr">Nickel et al. [2016b]</ref> uses the circular correlation operation, while TuckER <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Balazevic et al. [2019]</ref> relies on the Tucker decomposition.</p><p>Neural network-based models rely on neural networks to perform LP. In neural networks, the parameters (e.g. weights and biases) are organized into different layers, with usually non-linear activation functions between each of these layers.</p><p>The first introduced neural-network based model for LP is Neural Tensor Network (NTN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Socher et al. [2013]</ref>. It can be seen as a combination of multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and bilinear models <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Ji et al. [2022]</ref>. NTN defines a distinct neural network for each relation. This choice of parameterization makes NTN similar to RESCAL in the sense that both models achieve great expressiveness at the expense of computational concerns. The most recent neural network-based models rely on more sophisticated layers to perform a broader set of operations. Convolutional models are by far the most representative family of such models. They use convolutional layers to learn deep and expressive features from the input data, which pass through such layers to undergo convolution with low-dimensional filters ω. The resulting feature maps subsequently go through dense layers to obtain a final plausibility score. Compared with fully connected neural networks, convolution-based models are able to capture complex relationships with fewer parameters by learning non-linear features. While ConvE <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Dettmers et al. [2018]</ref> reshapes head entity and relation embeddings before concatenating them into a unique input matrix to pass through convolutional layers, ConvKB Nguyen et al.</p><p>[2018] does not perform any reshaping and also puts the tail embedding into the concatenated input matrix. Other models were later proposed, such as ConvR <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Jiang et al. [2019]</ref> and <ref type="bibr">InteractE Vashishth et al. [2020a]</ref> that both process triples independently. Another branch of convolutional models also considers the local neighborhood around each central entity. These are based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The most representative GNN-based model for LP is R-GCN Schlichtkrull et al. <ref type="bibr">[2018]</ref>. The key idea is to accumulate messages from the local neighborhood of the central node over multi-hop relations. By doing so, R-GCN is better able to model a long range of relational dependencies. However, R-GCN does not outperform baselines for the LP task <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Ferrari et al. [2022]</ref>. Subsequent models have claimed superiority over R-GCN: <ref type="bibr">SACN Shang et al. [2019]</ref> introduces a weighted GCN to adjust the amount of aggregated information from the local neighborhood and <ref type="bibr">KBGAT Nathani et al. [2019]</ref> relies on attention mechanism to generate more accurate embeddings. More recently, <ref type="bibr">CompGCN Vashishth et al. [2020b]</ref> and <software ContextAttributes="used">DisenKGAT</software> <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Wu et al. [2021]</ref> showcased impressive performance with regard to the LP task.</p></div>

Ontologies formally describe a specific application domain of interest (e.g. education, pharmacology, etc.) in which several classes (or concepts) and relations are identified and formally specified. Ontologies support KG construction by providing a schema that specifies the nature of entities, the semantic profile of relations, and other constraints that give the KG a semantic coherence.</p><p>A significant part of the literature incorporates such semantic information to constrain the negative sampling procedure and generate meaningful negative triples <ref type="bibr">Jain et al. [2021a]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Krompaß et al. [2015]</ref>. For instance, type-constrained negative sampling (TCNS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Krompaß et al.

[2021a]</ref> go a step further and use ontological reasoning to iteratively improve <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> performance by retraining the model on inconsistent predictions.</p><p>Semantic information can also be embedded in the model itself.

As stated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Paulheim Paulheim [2018]</ref>, because embeddings are not meant to preserve the semantics of the KG, they are not interpretable and this can severely hinder explainability in domains such as recommender systems. Consequently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Paulheim Paulheim [2018]</ref> advocates for semantic embeddings. Similarly, Jain et al. <ref type="bibr">Jain et al. [2021b]</ref> perform a thorough evaluation of popular <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> to better assess whether embeddings can express similarities between entities of the same type. A key finding is that because of overlapping relations among entities of different types, fine-grained semantics cannot be properly reflected by embeddings For instance, the task of finding semantically similar entities does not always provide satisfying results when working with entity embeddings <ref type="bibr">Jain et al.

Whether during the validation or test phase, <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> performance is evaluated the same way: sifting through every triple of the test (resp. validation) set, both head and tail predictions are performed. In the case of head prediction, this amounts to taking a triple (h, r, t) from the test (resp. validation) set, hiding the ground-truth head entity -resulting in (?, r, t) -and letting the <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> assign a score to every possible entity as a candidate for the head position. These scores are finally ordered and reflect the plausibility of such facts. Tail prediction is performed analogously on (h, r, ?).</p><p>In both cases, the rank of the ground-truth entity from the test (resp. validation) set is used to compute aggregated rank-based metrics based on the top-K scored entities. The rank of the ground-truth entity can be determined in two different ways that depend on how observed facts -i.e. facts that already exist in the KG -are considered. In the raw setting, observed facts outranking the ground-truth are not filtered out, while this is the case in the filtered setting. For instance, assuming head prediction is performed on the given ground-truth triple (BarackObama, livesIn, USA), a <software>KGEM</software> may assign a lower score to this triple than to the following triple: (MichelleObama, livesIn, USA). The latter triple actually represents an observed fact. In the raw setting, this triple would not be filtered out from top-K scored triples. This can cause the evaluation procedure to not properly assess the <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> performance. This is why in practice, the filtered setting is commonly preferred. In the present work, the filtered setting is also used.</p><p><software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> performance is almost exclusively assessed using the following rank-based metrics: Hits@K, Mean Rank (MR), and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hoyt et al. [2022]</ref>. Disagreements exist as to how and when these metrics can be used and compared properly. In the following, we recall their definitions and discuss their limits.</p><p>Hits@K (Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)) accounts for the proportion of ground-truth triples appearing in the first K top-scored triples:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Hits@K = 1 |B| q∈B 1 [rank(q) ≤ K] (1)</formula><p>where B is the batch of ground-truth triples, rank(q) is the position of the ground-truth triple q in the sorted list of triples, and 1 [rank(q) ≤ K] yields 1 if q is ranked between 1 and K, 0 otherwise. This metric is bounded in the [0, 1] range and its values increase with K, where the higher the better.</p><p>Mean Rank (MR) (Eq. ( <ref type="formula">2</ref>)) corresponds to the arithmetic mean over ranks of ground-truth triples:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">MR = 1 |B| q∈B rank(q) (2)</formula><p>This metric is bounded in the [0, |E|] interval, where |E| stands for the number of entities in the KG, where the lower the better.</p><p>Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) (Eq. ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>)) corresponds to the arithmetic mean over reciprocals of ranks of ground-truth triples:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">MRR = 1 |B| q∈B 1 rank(q)</formula><p>(3) Contrary to MR, MRR is a metric bounded in the [0, 1] interval. Higher results indicate better performance. Because this metric does not use any threshold K compared to Hits@K, it is less sensitive to outliers. In addition, it is often used for performing early stopping and for tracking the best epoch during training <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Berrendorf et al. [2020]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hoyt et al. [2022]</ref>.</p><p>As mentioned in Section 1, these metrics present some caveats. LP is often used to complete knowledge graphs, where the Open World Assumption (OWA) prevails. KGs are incomplete and, due to the OWA, an unobserved triple used as a negative one can still be positive. It follows that traditional evaluation methods based on rank-based metrics may systematically underestimate the true performance of a <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Wang et al. [2019]</ref>.</p><p>In addition, the aforementioned rank-based metrics have intrinsic and theoretical flaws, as pointed out in several works <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Berrendorf et al. [2020]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hoyt et al. [2022]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Tiwari et al. [2021]</ref>. For example, Hits@K does not take into account triples whose rank is larger than K. As such, a model scoring the ground-truth in position K + 1 would be considered equally good as another model scoring the ground-truth in position K + d with d ≫ 1. It follows that Hits@K is not a suitable metric for drawing comparisons between models <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Hoyt et al. [2022]</ref>. MR alleviates this concern as it does not consider any threshold K. In Section 2.2, several approaches incorporating the semantics of entities and relations into the embeddings were mentioned. However, in such cases, the use of semantic information such as entity types and the hierarchy of classes is intended to improve <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> performance in terms of the aforementioned rank-based metrics only. The underlying semantics of KGs is considered as an additional source of information during training but the ability of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> to generate predictions in accordance with these semantic constraints is never directly addressed. This encourages further assessment of the semantic capabilities of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software>, as firstly suggested in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hubert et al. [2022b]</ref>. In our work, we directly address this issue by assessing to what extent <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> are able to give high scores to triples whose head (resp. tail) belongs to the domain (resp. range) of the relation. When such information is not available -i.e. the KG does not rely on a schema containing rdfs:domain and rdfs:range properties -extensional constraints can still be used to evaluate the semantic capabilities of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software>, as detailed in Section 4.</p><p>3 Motivations and problem formulation</p></div>
<div><head n="3.1">Motivating example</head><p>To motivate the use of Sem@K to evaluate <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> quality, this section builds upon a minimalist example which is representative of the issue encountered while benchmarking the performance of several <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> on the same dataset. As depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, two <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> that have been trained on the whole training set are tested on a batch of test triples. These KGEMs are referred to as Model A and Model B. Without loss of generality, it is assumed that the test set only comprises the three triples shown in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. For the sake of clarity, only the tail prediction pass and the top-5 ranked candidate entities are depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. It should be noted that the performance of both models are strictly equal in terms of MR, MRR and Hits@K with K ≤ 5: MR=8/3, Hits@1=1/3, Hits@3=2/3 and Hits@5=1. MRR can only be computed knowing the total number of entities in the KG but two models having the same MR on the same dataset have de facto the same MRR as well. Distinguishing between these two models by relying solely on traditional rank-based metrics is not possible. One might even draw the misleading conclusion that these models are equally good. But they are not: Model A gives high scores to semantically valid entities with regard to the range of relations, while Model B semantic awareness is very low. In other words, Model B does not capture the semantic profile of relations well. This case in point illustrates the need for using semantic-oriented metrics alongside common rank-based metrics, so as to better assess the overall quality of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software>.</p></div>
<div><head n="3.2">Problem formulation</head><p>The traditional evaluation of <software>KGEMs</software> solely based on rank-based metrics can be flawed for several reasons. First, <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> benchmarked on the same test sets can exhibit very similar results. Using only rank-based metrics, the final choice only depends on the best achieved MRR and/or Hits@K. This raises the questions whether the chosen  Model A and Model B output scores for each possible entity and only the top-five ranked tail candidates are depicted here. Model A and Model B have the same Hits@1, Hits@3 and Hits@5 values. But Model A has better semantic capabilities. Green, blue and white cells respectively denote the ground-truth entity, entities other than the ground-truth and semantically valid, and entities other than the ground-truth and semantically invalid model is actually the best one, or whether its slight superiority over other <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> can be due to other factors such as better hyperparameter tuning or better modeling of a relational pattern highly present in the test set. Moreover, using only rank-based metrics does not provide the full picture of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> quality for the downstream LP task, as some dimensions of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> are left unassessed (see Section 2). In this work, contrary to the mainstream approach consisting in comparing <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> performance exclusively in terms of rank-based metrics, the trained <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> are also evaluated in terms of Sem@K which measures the ability of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> to predict semantically valid triples with respect to the domain and range of relations.</p><p>4 Measuring <software>KGEMs</software> semantic awareness with Sem@K</p><p>The standard LP evaluation protocol consists in reporting aggregated results, considering the rank-based metrics presented in Section 2.3. As mentioned above, these metrics only provide a partial picture of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Berrendorf et al. [2020]</ref>. To give a more comprehensive assessment of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software>, we aim at assessing their semantic awareness using our proposed metric called Sem@K <ref type="bibr">Hubert et al. [2022a,b]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr">Hubert et al. [2022a]</ref>, Sem@K was specifically defined for the recommendation task which was seen as predicting tails for a unique target relation. Sem@K was then extended in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hubert et al. [2022b]</ref> to the more generic LP task, where not only tails but also heads are corrupted and all relations are considered. In this work, this original formalization for LP is presented in Section 4.1, and enriched to take into account schemaless KGs (Section 4.3), or KGs with a class hierarchy (Section 4.4). As a consequence, Sem@K comes in 3 different versions (respectively denoted Sem@K[base], Sem@K[ext], and Sem@K[wup]) so as to adapt to KG typology. These distinct versions and their adequacy regarding the KG at hand are summarized in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and further detailed below. In the following, when no suffix is provided, it is assumed that we are concerned with Sem@K in general, regardless of the actual version.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref>: Typology of KGs and their respective adequacy for the presented Sem@K versions KG type Sem</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">@K[ext] Sem@K[base] Sem@K[wup] Schemaless × Schema-defined, w/o class hierarchy × × Schema-defined, w/ class hierarchy × × × 4.1 Definition of Sem@K[base]</formula><p>This version of Sem@K (Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>)) accounts for the proportion of triples that are semantically valid in the first K top-scored triples:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">Sem@K = 1 |B| q∈B 1 K q ′ ∈S K q compatibility(q, q ′ ) (4)</formula><p>where, given a ground-truth triple q = (h, r, t), S K q is the list of the top-K candidate triples scored by a given <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> (i.e. by predicting the tail for (h, r, ?) or the head for (?, r, t)). The function compatibility(q, q ′ ) (Eq. ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">5</ref>)) assesses whether the candidate triple q ′ is semantically compatible with its ground-truth counterpart q. In this work, by semantic compatibility we refer to the fact that the predicted head (resp. tail) belongs to the domain (resp. range) of the relation:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">compatibility(q, q ′ ) = 1, if types(q ′ h ) ∩ domain(q r ) ̸ = ∅ ∧ types(q ′ t ) ∩ range(q r ) ̸ = ∅ 0, otherwise<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where types(e) returns the types of entity e and domain(r) (resp. range(r)) is the domain (resp. range) of the relation r. q r , q ′ h , and q ′ t denote the ground-truth relation, the head and the tail of the ranked triple q ′ , respectively. It is noteworthy that with this formula, we allow entities to instantiate multiple types, and domains and ranges to be defined with multiple types. Sem@K is bounded in the [0, 1] interval. Compared to Hits@K (Eq. ( <ref type="formula">1</ref>)), Sem@K is non-monotonic: increasing K can lead to either lower or higher Sem@K values.</p></div>
<div><head n="4.2">A note on Sem@K, untyped entities, and the Open World Assumption</head><p>Traditional <software>KGEM</software> evaluation can be performed in all situations, regardless of whether entities are typed or whether the KG comes with a proper schema. When measuring the semantic capability of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> -e.g. with Sem@K -some concerns arise. For instance, a fair question to ask is the following: how should untyped entities be considered? Indeed, in some KGs, some entities are left untyped. For example, in DBpedia the entity dbr:1._FC_Union_Berlin_players does not belong to any other class than owl:Thing. In some other cases as in DB15K and DB100K d'Amato et al.</p><p>[2021], entities have incomplete typing.</p><p>Under the OWA, an untyped entity should not count in the calculation of Sem@K since it is not possible to determine whether this entity has no types or no known types. Although this seems to be a fair option, it raises a major issue: it makes possible to score different sets of entities with rank-based metrics and Sem@K, which is not desirable. If there are M untyped entities in an ordered list of ranked entities, Hits@K, MR and MRR are calculated regardless of this fact, i.e. still taking into account the M untyped entities. However, Sem@K cannot be calculated for these M untyped entities. As such, MR, MRR and Hits@K would be calculated on the original entity set, whereas Sem@K would be computed on a different set of entities. This issue would be even more acute in the case of Sem@1 when the first ranked entity is untyped: Hits@1 and Sem@1 would be calculated on two different entities, which is not acceptable. Consequently, one strategy consists in removing untyped entities from the evaluation protocol, both regarding rank-based and semantic-based metrics. By doing so, consistency is ensured in the ranked list of entities across rank-based and semantic metrics evaluation.</p></div>
<div><head n="4.3">Sem@K[ext] for schemaless KGs</head><p>Not all KGs come with a proper schema, e.g. relations do not appear in any rdfs:domain or rdfs:range clauses. In that particular situation, it can still be desirable to assess the semantic awareness of <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software>. One approach is to maintain a list of all entities that have been observed as heads (resp. tails) of each relation r : domain(r) = {e : ∃(e, r, t) ∈ T } (resp. range(r) = {e : ∃(h, r, e) ∈ T }). Hence, in this case, Sem@K[ext] is defined as in Eq. ( <ref type="formula">4</ref>) and (5) but using these definitions of domain and range. Therefore, an entity will be considered as a semantically valid head (resp. tail) with respect to the relation if this entity appears as a head (resp. tail) in any other triple observed in the KG with the same relation. Sem@K as previously defined equally penalizes all entities that are not of the expected type. However, KGs may be equipped with a class hierarchy that, in turn, can support a more fine-grained penalty for entities depending on the distance or similarity between their type and the expected domain (resp. range) in this hierarchy. To illustrate, consider Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> that depicts a subset of the DBpedia ontology dbo class hierarchy. Using the hierarchy-free version of Sem@K for the test triple (dbr:The_Social_Network, dbo:director, dbr:David_Fincher), predicting dbr:Friends or dbr:Central_Park as head would be penalized the same way in the compatibility function. However, it is clear that an entity of class dbo:TelevisionShow is semantically closer to dbo:Film -the domain of the relation dbo:director -than an entity of class dbo:Park, and thus should be less penalized.</p><p>To leverage such a semantic relatedness between concepts in Sem@K, the compatibility function can be adapted accordingly:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">compatibility(q, q ′ ) = min    max c∈type(q ′ h ) c ′ ∈domain(qr) σ(c, c ′ ), max c∈type(q ′ t ) c ′ ∈range(qr) σ(c, c ′ )    (6)</formula><p>where σ(c, c ′ ) measure the semantic similarity between the two classes c and c ′ based on the class hierarchy. It should be noted that in this formula type(e) only returns the most specific classes instantiated by e.</p><p>Several similarity measures σ have been proposed in the literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Rada et al. [1989]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wu and Palmer [1994]</ref>, <ref type="bibr">Leacock and Chodorow [1998]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Resnik [1999]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">Li et al. [2003]</ref>. In this work, the Wu-Palmer similarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Wu and Palmer [1994]</ref> (Eq. 7) is used:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">σ (c, c ′ ) = 2 × δ (c ∧ c ′ , ρ) δ (c, c ∧ c ′ ) + δ (c ′ , c ∧ c ′ ) + 2 × δ (c ∧ c ′ , ρ) (7)</formula><p>where ρ is the root of the hierarchy (e.g. owl:Thing), δ (c, c ′ ) is the number of edges linking c to c ′ , and c ∧ c ′ represents the least common subsumer of c and c ′ . The Wu-Palmer similarity is well suited to a class hierarchy and provides a good indication of the semantic relatedness between the domain (resp. range) class and the classes of the chosen entity. This gives rise to the Sem@K[wup] version.</p><p>Considering the example in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>, using the Wu-Palmer score in the calculation of Sem@K, a head prediction of dbr:Friends and dbr:Central_Park for the ground-truth triple (dbr:The_Social_Network, dbo:director, dbr:David_Fincher) are now differently penalized. The instance dbr:Friends is of type dbo:TelevisionShow, so we have: σ (dbo:TelevisionShow, dbo:Film) = 1/2. The instance dbr:Central_Park is of type dbo:Park, so we have: σ (dbo:Park, dbo:Film) = 0. This illustrates that incorporating the Wu-Palmer score into Sem@K calculation leads to more precise semantic comparisons that take into account the available class hierarchy. It should be noted that comparing the classes of a candidate entity with the expected class can result in the same penalization as the vanilla version of Sem@K. However, in most cases, two classes do not lie in a completely disjoint part of the hierarchy of classes. As such, the Wu-Palmer score between the classes of a candidate entity and the expected class is rarely 0.</p><p>5 Experimental setting</p></div>
<div><head n="5.1">Datasets</head><p>In order to draw reliable and general conclusions, a broad range of KGs are used in our experiments. They have been chosen due to their mainstream adoption in recent research works around <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> for LP and the fact that they have different characteristics (e.g. entities, relations, classes, presence of a class hierarchy). In this section, the schemadefined and schemaless KGs used in the experiments are detailed. Note that in our experiments, all the schema-defined KGs come with a class hierarchy inherited from either Freebase <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Bollacker et al. [2008]</ref>, DBpedia <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Auer et al. [2007]</ref>, YAGO <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Suchanek et al. [2007]</ref>, or schema.org. To meet requirements for evaluating <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> w.r.t. Sem@K (i.e. classes instantiated by entities, domain and range for relations), when necessary, subsets of schema-defined KGs are used, as explained in Section 5.1.1. Among the 4 schema-defined KGs presented hereafter, FB15K237-ET, DB93K and YAGO3-37K are derived from already existing KGs, while YAGO4-19K was specifically created and is made available on Zenodo<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> and GitHub<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">3</ref> . The other KGs are made available on GitHub<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">4</ref> .</p></div>
<div><head n="5.1.1">Schema-defined KGs</head><p>The statistics of the datasets FB15K237-ET, DB93K, YAGO3-37K and YAGO4-19K used in our experiments are provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>. As discussed in Section 4.2, to create an experimental evaluation setting as unbiased and flawless as possible, the schema-defined KGs used in the experiments are filtered to keep typed entities only. This way, Sem@K is calculated under the CWA.</p><p>FB15K237-ET derives from FB15K <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bordes et al. [2013]</ref> -a dataset extracted from the cross-domain Freebase <ref type="bibr">KG Bollacker et al. [2008]</ref>. In these experiments, we do not use FB15K, as it has been noted that this dataset suffers from test leakage, i.e., a large number of test triples can be obtained by simply inverting the position of the head and tail in the train triples <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Toutanova and Chen [2015]</ref>. The later introduced FB15K237 dataset Toutanova and Chen [2015] is a subset of the original FB15K without these inverse relations. To the best of our knowledge, there is no schema-defined version of FB15K237. However, a schema-defined version of FB15K is provided in <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Xie et al. [2016]</ref>. Consequently, we based ourselves on this version of FB15K and mapped the extracted entity types, relation domains and ranges to the entities and relations found in FB15K237. The resulting schema-defined version of FB15K237 is named FB15K237-ET and includes only typed entities. Besides, validation and test sets contain triples whose relation have a well-defined domain (resp. range), as well as more than 10 possible candidates as head (resp. tail). This ensures Sem@K is not unduly penalized and can be calculated on the same set of entities as Hits@K and MRR, at least until K = 10.</p><p>DB93K is a subset of DB100K, which was first introduced in Ding et al. <ref type="bibr">[2018]</ref>. A slightly modified version of DB100K has been proposed in d'Amato et al. <ref type="bibr">[2021]</ref>. Contrary to the initial version of DB100K, the latter version is schema-defined: entities are properly typed and most relations have a domain and/or a range. This second version is considered in the following experiments. However, some inconsistencies were found in the dataset. Some DBpedia entities only instantiate Wikidata<ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">5</ref> or schema.org<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">6</ref> classes, while instantiation of classes from the DBpedia ontology actually exist. Moreover, some entities are only partially typed. It must also be noted that domains and ranges of relations have been extracted from DBpedia more than two years ago. DBpedia is a communautary and open-source project: DBpedia classification system relies on human curation, which sometimes implies a lack of coverage for some resources and updates for others. Consequently we associated all relations of DB100K to their most up-to-date domains and ranges<ref type="foot" target="#foot_5">7</ref> . Similarly for entities, we associated all entities to their most up-to-date classes. Finally, we removed all untyped entities as well as validation and test relations having less than 10 observed entities, so as not to unfairly penalize Sem@K results in the validation and test phases.</p><p>YAGO3-37K derives from the schema-defined YAGO39K dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Lv et al. [2018]</ref> extracted from the cross-domain YAGO3 <ref type="bibr">KG Suchanek et al. [2007]</ref>. Compared to the original YAGO39K, in our experiments only typed entities are kept. In addition, relations having less than 10 observed heads or tails in the training set are discarded from the validation and test splits, for the same reason that keeping them would not reflect the actual Sem@K values. It should be noted that in the YAGO3 ontology, most relations have very generic domains and ranges which are very close to the root of the ontology hierarchy. To produce a more challenging evaluation setting of the models' semantic awareness, a We built YAGO4-19K with several other subsets of the YAGO4 knowledge graph Tanon et al. <ref type="bibr">[2020]</ref>. Similarly to other datasets, we focused on relations with a defined domain and range, and more than 10 triples to constitute the validation and test sets. We purposedly favored difficult relations to feature in the validation and test sets. To enrich the training set, additional relations were added based on a manual selection. Selected relations in validation and test sets as well as additional relations in the training set can be found on the GitHub repository of the dataset. It should be noted that the class hierarchy associated with entities in YAGO 4 is schema.org.</p></div>

Consequently, the two entity representations e h and e t are learned independently. Likewise, each relation r comes with a direct and an inverse vectors e r and e r -1 . The scoring function reflects the interaction between all the aforementioned entity and relation embeddings: embeddings and layers of nonlinear features. The output is ultimately scored against the tail embedding t using the dot product. More precisely, the following scoring function is used: f (h, r, t) = g (vec (g (concat ( e h , e r ) * ω)) W) • e t (13) where g denotes a non-linear function, vec is the vectorization operation reshaping a tensor into a vector, concat is the concatenation operator, * and . denote a convolution and a dot product, respectively, e denotes a 2D reshaping of e and ω is the set of convolutional filters.</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">f (h, r, t) = 1 2 ( e h h ,</formula><p>ConvKB Nguyen et al. <ref type="bibr">[2018]</ref> also represents entities and relations as same-sized vectors.

Convolution by a set ω of T filters of shape 1 * 3 is applied on this input. The resulting T * 3 feature map then passes through a dense layer with one neuron and a weight matrix W .

[2018]</ref> extends the idea of applying graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to multi-relational data. R-GCN operates on local graph neighborhoods and applies a convolution operation to the neighbors of each entity. By aggregating the messages coming from all the neighbors of an entity, the embedding of the latter is updated in accordance. Each entity thus has a hidden representation which directly depends on the hidden representations of its neighbors. This process of accumulating messages (i.e. the hidden representations of neighboring entities) and aggregating them so as to update the hidden representation of the central node is performed for each layer of the R-GCN model. More formally, the hidden representation of the entity i in the layer (l + 1) is defined as:</p></div>

To update entity hidden representation taking into account its previous state, a self-connection is also incorporated into the activation function σ(.). Such layers can be stacked multiple times in order to better learn interactions and dependencies across several relational steps. However, as applying Eq.( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">15</ref>) directly would dramatically increase the number of parameters for KGs having lots of different relation types, basis-decomposition and block-diagonal-decomposition are proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Schlichtkrull et al.

Regarding Sem@K, the relative hierarchy of models is consistent across KGs and we can clearly see that <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> are grouped by families of models competitive in terms of Sem@K[base]. In Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, we clearly see that they consistently rank among the best performing models regarding Sem@K[base].

In addition, it should be noted that R-GCN provides satisfying results as well. Except in a very few cases (e.g. outperformed by ComplEx on Codex-S and WN18RR in terms of Sem@1), R-GCN showcases better semantic awareness than semantic matching models. Most of the time, R-GCN also provides comparable or even higher semantic capabilities than translational models.

This ability may be attributed to the fact that, contrary to translational models which only model the local neighborhood of each triple, GNNs update entity embeddings (and relation embeddings in the case of CompGCN) based on the information found in the extended, h-hop neighborhood of the central node. While translational and semantic matching models treat each triple independently, GNNs model interactions between entities on a large range of semantic relations. It is likely that this extended neighborhood comprises signals or patterns that help the model infer the classes of entities, thus providing very promising semantic capabilities in all experimental conditions.</p></div>
<div><head n="6.2">Dynamic appraisal of KGEM semantic awareness</head><p>For certain models, rank-based metrics performance and semantic capabilities improve jointly. For others, the enhancement of their performance in terms of rank-based metrics comes at the expense of their semantic awareness. Interestingly, trends emerge relatively to families of models. First, we observe that a trade-off exists for semantic matching models. Results are particularly striking on FB15K237-ET (see Fig. <ref type="figure">8</ref>), where it is obvious that after reaching the best Sem@K values after a few epochs, Sem@K values of <software ContextAttributes="used">DistMult</software> and ComplEx quickly drop while MRR continues rising. Conversely, translational models are more robust to Sem@K degradation throughout the epochs. Even though the best achieved Sem@K values are also reported in the very first epochs, once these values are reached they remain stable for the remaining epochs of training. This might be due to the geometric nature of such <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software>, which will organize the representation space so as to h + r falls in a region of the space where neighboring entities of the ground-truth tail t all are entities of the expected type. This is highly related to the block structure property, which is a common statistical pattern found in KGs <ref type="bibr">Nickel et al. [2016a]</ref>. It refers to the fact that entities can naturally belong to different groups (blocks), such that all the entities of a given group are linked to entities of another group through the same relationship. In this case, each group comprises entities of the same class. Translational models will naturally group entities of the same class in the same region of the representation space, as this is determined by the translation vector in that space. Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>: Evolution of MRR ( ), Sem@1 ( ), Sem@3 ( ), and Sem@10 ( ) for translational <ref type="bibr">(<software>TransE</software>, TransH)</ref> and semantic matching models (<software ContextAttributes="used">DistMult</software>, ComplEx) on FB15K237-ET Plots of the joint evolution of MRR and Sem@K values show that most of the <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> reaches their best Sem@K values after a few number of epochs. This means that predictions get semantically valid in the early stages of training. As previously mentioned, Sem@K then usually start to decrease, as it has been noted for semantic matching models in particular. To this respect, an excerpt of the head and tail predictions of <software ContextAttributes="used">DistMult</software> on YAGO3-37K is depicted in Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>. Even though the ground-truth entity does not show up in neither the head nor the tail top-K list, we clearly see that after only 30 epochs of training, predictions made by <software ContextAttributes="used">DistMult</software> are more meaningful than after 400 epochs of training. This relative trade-off between making semantically valid predictions and predictions that comprise the ground-truth entity higher in the top-K list calls for finding a compromise in terms of training. The LP task is usually addressed in terms of rank-based metrics only, hence the choice of performing more and more training epochs so as to find the optimal <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> in terms of MRR and Hits@K. However, as discussed in the present work, adding training steps may improve <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> performance at the expense of its semantic awareness. In many cases, rank-based metrics values only slightly increase, whereas Sem@K values drastically drop. For instance, comparing MRR vs. Sem@K evolution of <software ContextAttributes="used">DistMult</software> on FB15K237-ET (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">10c</ref>), we clearly see that after a moderate number of epochs, any additional epoch of training only provides a very slight improvement in terms of MRR, while it is very detrimental to Sem@K values. Depending on the use case, such a decline in the semantic capabilities of the model is not desirable, and a compromise is to be found between training more to increase <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEM</software> predictive performance and stopping training early enough so as not to deteriorate its semantic awareness too much.</p></div>
<div><head n="6.3">On the use of Sem@K for different kinds of KGs</head><p>As reported in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, KGs based upon a schema and a class hierarchy are candidates for the computation of all the versions of Sem@K. For the schema-defined KGs used in our experiments, we choose to report values regarding all these metrics so as to enable multi-view comparisons across models. From Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">8</ref> it can be clearly seen that the relative superiority of models is consistent throughout the different Sem@K definitions. From a higher perspective, this means that even for schema-defined KGs with a hierarchy class, Sem@K[ext] is already a good proxy. This may be a good option to only rely on the Sem@K[ext] whenever the computation of Sem@K[base] is too expensive, due to the entity type checking part. This is even more true for Sem@K[wup], which requires an additional step of semantic relatedness computation.</p><p>&lt;Mozambique&gt; &lt;hasCapital&gt; &lt;Maputo&gt; </p></div>

<div><head n="7">Discussion</head><p>Three major research questions have been formulated in Section 1. Based on the analysis presented in Section 6, we discuss each research question individually. We ultimately discuss the potential for further considerations of semantics into <software>KGEMs</software>.</p><p>7.1 RQ1: how semantic-aware agnostic <software>KGEMs</software> are?</p><p>From a coarse-grained viewpoint, we noted that <software>KGEMs</software> trained in an agnostic way prove capable of giving higher scores to semantically valid triples. However, disparities exist between models. Interestingly, these disparities seem to derive from the family of such models. Globally, translational models and GNNs -represented by R-GCN and CompGCN in this work -provide promising results. It appears that the two aforementioned families of <software ContextAttributes="created">KGEMs</software> are better able than semantic matching models (<software ContextAttributes="created">DistMult</software>, ComplEx, <software ContextAttributes="created">SimplE</software>) at recovering the semantics of entities and relations to give higher score to semantically valid triples. In fact, semantic matching models are almost systematically the worst performing models in terms of semantic awareness. From a dynamic standpoint, it is worth noting the high semantic capabilities of <software ContextAttributes="created">KGEMs</software> reached during the first epochs of training. In most cases, this is even during the first epochs that the optimal semantic awareness is attained.</p></div>
<div><head n="7.2">RQ2: how KGEM semantic awareness' evaluation should adapt to the typology of KGs?</head><p>Drawing on the initial version of Sem@K as presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Hubert et al. [2022b]</ref> -referred to herein as Sem@K[base] -an issue is quickly encountered when it comes to schemaless KGs, which do not contain any rdfs:domain (resp. rdfs:range) clause to indicate the class that candidate heads (resp. tails) should belong to. Our work introduces Sem@K[ext] -a new version of Sem@K that overcomes the aforementioned limitation. In addition, even with schema-defined KGs, Sem@K[base] is not necessarily sufficient in itself. This metric can be further enriched whenever a KG comes with a class hierarchy. In Section 4.4, we integrate class hierarchy into Sem@K by means of a similarity measure between concepts. We subsequently provide an example using the Wu-Palmer similarity score. The resulting Sem@K[wup] is used in the experiments in Section 6 and provide a finer-grained measure of <software ContextAttributes="created">KGEMs</software> semantic awareness.</p><p>7.3 RQ3: does the evaluation of KGEM semantic awareness offers different conclusions on the relative superiority of some KGEMs?</p><p>A major finding is that models performing well with respect to rank-based metrics are not necessarily the most competitive regarding their semantic capabilities. We previously noted that translational models globally showcase better Sem@K values compared to semantic matching models. Considering MRR and Hits@K, the opposite conclusion is often drawn. Hence, the performance of <software>KGEMs</software> in terms of rank-based metrics is not indicative of their semantic capabilities. The only exception that might exist is for GNNs that perform well both in terms of rank-based metrics and semantic-oriented measures.</p><p>The answers provided to the research questions also lead to consider new matters. As evidenced in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_15">8</ref> and Table <ref type="table">9</ref>, some KGs are more challenging with regard to Sem@K results. Due to its tailored extraction strategy that purposedly favored difficult relations to feature in the validation and test sets, YAGO4-19K is the schema-defined KG with the lowest achieved Sem@K. This observation raises a deeper question: what characteristics of a KG make it inherently challenging for <software ContextAttributes="created">KGEMs</software> to recover the semantics of entities and relations? An extensive study of the influence of KGs characteristics on the semantic capabilities of <software ContextAttributes="created">KGEMs</software> would require to benchmark them on a broad set of KGs with varying dimensions, so as to determine those that are the most prevalent. Such characteristics can be the total number of relations, the average number of instances per class, or a combination of different factors. We leave this experimental study for future work.</p><p>Recall that this work is motivated by the possibility of going beyond a mere assessment of <software>KGEM</software> performance regarding rank-based metrics. We showed that these metrics only evaluate one aspect of such models, somehow providing a partial view on the quality of <software ContextAttributes="created">KGEMs</software>. Our proposal for further assessing <software ContextAttributes="created">KGEM</software> semantic capabilities aims at diving deeper into their predictive expressiveness and measuring to what extent their predictions are semantically valid. However, this second evaluation component does not shed full light on the respective <software ContextAttributes="created">KGEM</software> peculiarities. Other evaluation components may be added, such as the storage and computational requirements of <software ContextAttributes="created">KGEMs</software> Wang et al.</p><p>[2021c], <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Portisch et al. [2020]</ref> and the environmental impact of their training and testing procedure <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Peng et al. [2021]</ref>.

<div><head n="7.4">Towards further considerations of semantics in knowledge graph embeddings models</head><p>The Sem@K metric presented in this work allows for a more comprehensive evaluation of <software>KGEMs</software>. Based on domains and ranges of relations, Sem@K assesses to what extent the predictions of a model are semantically valid. The present work constitutes one of several stepping stones toward the further consideration of ontological and semantic information in <software ContextAttributes="created">KGEM</software> design and evaluation.</p><p>It should be noted that due to the only consideration of domains and ranges, Sem@K cannot indicate whether predictions are logically consistent with other constraints posed by the ontology. This is in contrast with Inc@K presented in <ref type="bibr">Jain et al. [2021a]</ref> that takes a broader set of ontological axioms into account. However, Inc@K and Sem@K intrinsically assess distinct dimensions of predictions. While the former is concerned with the logical consistency of predictions, the latter focuses on whether these predictions are semantically valid. For instance, an ontology can specify that City is the range of livesIn, that Seattle is a City but not a Capital, and that entities of type President should be linked to a Capital through the relation livesIn. Hence, it would still be meaningful and semantically correct to predict that (BarackObama,livesIn,Seattle). However, this prediction is not logically consistent w.r.t. ontology specifications. Inc@K and SemK thus consider triples at different levels: while a given triple can be meaningful and semantically correct on its own, its combination with other triples may not be semantically valid or consistent with the ontology. In future work, we will consider more expressive ontologies and see how the broad collection of axioms that constitute them can be incorporated into Sem@K.</p><p><software ContextAttributes="created">KGEMs</software> evaluated in this work are all agnostic to ontological information in their design. However, some models that consider or ensure specific ontological or logical properties exist. For example, HAKE <ref type="bibr">Zhang et al. [2020a]</ref> is constructed with the purpose of preserving hierarchies, Logic Tensor Networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Badreddine et al. [2022]</ref> are designed to ensure logical reasoning, and the training of <ref type="bibr">TransOWL and TransROWL d'Amato et al. [2021]</ref> is enriched with additional triples deduced from, e.g., inverse predicates or equivalent classes. Because of the integration of semantic information in their design or training, one could wonder if they present improved semantic awareness compared to agnostic models. Additionally, <software ContextAttributes="created">KGEMs</software> can also be used to predict triples that represent class instantiations. A possible extension of the present work thus consists in studying whether predicted links and class instantiations are consistent and lead to increased Sem@K values. This would further qualify and highlight the semantic awareness and the consistency of predictions of <software ContextAttributes="created">KGEMs</software>. We leave these questions for future work.</p></div>
<div><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>In this work, we consider the link prediction task and extend our previously introduced Sem@K metric to measure the ability of <software>KGEMs</software> to assign higher scores to triples that are semantically valid. In particular, to adapt to different types of KGs (e.g., schemaless, class hierarchy), we introduce Sem@K[base], Sem@K[ext], or Sem@K[wup]. Compared with the traditional evaluation approach that solely relies on rank-based metrics, we show that the evaluation procedure is enhanced with the addition of semantic-oriented metrics that bring an additional perspective on <software ContextAttributes="created">KGEM</software> quality. Our experiments with different types of KGs highlight that there is no clear correlation between the performance of <software ContextAttributes="created">KGEMs</software> in terms of traditional rank-based metrics versus their performance regarding semantic-oriented ones. In some cases, however, a trade-off does exist. Consequently, this calls for monitoring <software ContextAttributes="created">KGEM</software> training under more scrutiny. Our experiments also point out that most of the conclusions that have been drawn actually hold at the level of families of models.</p><p>In future work, we will conduct experiments considering a broader array of <software>KGEM</software> families (e.g., <software ContextAttributes="used">KGEMs</software> that include semantics) and propose evaluation metrics that consider additional and more expressive ontological constraints.</p></div>

Concretely, CompGCN performs a composition operation ϕ(.) over each edge in the neighborhood of a central node. The composed embeddings are subsequently convolved with direction-specific weight matrices W O and W I -for original and inverse relations, respectively. In addition to the entity representation update, relation representations are also updated individually:</figDesc></figure>

<figure type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head /><label /><figDesc>Therefore, MR allows to compare KGEM performance on the same dataset. Nonetheless, MR is sensitive to the number of KG entities (see Eq. (2))<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Berrendorf et al. [2020]</ref>: a MR of 10 indicates very good performance if the set of entities is in the thousands, but it would indicate poor performance if the set of entities is much more restricted. Therefore, MR does not allow comparisons across datasets.Recent works recommend using adjusted version of the aforementioned metrics. The Adjusted Mean Rank (AMR) proposed in<ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Ali et al. [2022]</ref> compares the mean rank against the expected mean rank under a model with random scores. In<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Berrendorf et al. [2020]</ref>, Berrendorf et al. transform the AMR to define the Adjusted Mean Rank Index (AMRI) bounded in the [0, 1] interval. This way, a value of 1 indicates an optimal performance of the model. A value of 0 indicates a model performance similar to a model assigning random scores. A negative value indicates that the model performs worse than random. However, all these attempts at producing a better evaluation framework still focus on the quantitative assessment of KGEMs, i.e. the improvement of already existing rank-based metrics.</figDesc><table /></figure>

Besides, relations such as derivationally related from can contain nouns, verbs or adjectives as both head or tail. It follows that it is not possible to infer any expected entity type for relations -in this case the word qualifier. This is why WN18RR is used in the extensional setting.<ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Safavi and Koutra [2020]</ref> and Codex-M Safavi and Koutra [2020] are datasets extracted from Wikidata and Wikipedia.

Consequently, these datasets prove to be more challenging for the link prediction task. Compared to WN18RR, Codex-S and Codex-M contain entity types, relation descriptions and Wikipedia page extracts. Nonetheless, Wikidata does not contain rdfs:domain or rdfs:range predicates. The property constraints present in Wikidata are harder to manipulate than the rdfs:domain and rdfs:range clauses found in DBpedia.
