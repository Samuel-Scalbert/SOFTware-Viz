<div><p>Medico-administrative databases contain information about patients' medical events, i.e. their care trajectories. Semantic Web technologies are used by epidemiologists to query these databases in order to identify patients whose care trajectories conform to some criteria. In this article we are interested in care trajectories involving temporal constraints. In such cases, Semantic Web tools lack computational efficiency while temporal pattern matching algorithms are efficient but lack of expressiveness. We propose to use a temporal pattern called chronicles to represent temporal constraints on care trajectories. We also propose an hybrid approach, combining the expressiveness of <software>SPARQL</software> and the efficiency of chronicle recognition to query care trajectories. We evaluate our approach on synthetic data and real large data. The results show that the hybrid approach is more efficient than pure <software ContextAttributes="used">SPARQL</software>, and validate the interest of our tool to detect patients having venous thromboembolism disease in the French medico-administrative database.</p></div>

<div><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Pharmaco-epidemiology (PE) studies the conditions and consequences of health products, i.e. drugs or medical devices usage at the population scale in real situations using methodologies developed in general epidemiology.</p><p>Modern PE relies on administrative databases to perform such studies on care trajectories, i.e. on patient-centered sequences of drugs deliveries, medical procedures and hospitalizations. The use of medico-administrative databases (MADB) is useful in PE studies, since data are readily available and cover a large population.</p><p>The problem with MADB is the semantic gap between raw data and the epidemiological question. On the one side, epidemiologists are looking for medical events. For instance, they would like to identify patients suffering from venous thromboembolism (VTE). On the other side, raw data are related to reimbursements of medical acts or drug deliveries. There is no exploitable diagnosis available in administrative databases and no clinical results related to medical acts or exams.</p><p>The challenge for epidemiologists is to define phenotypes of medical events <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Hong et al., 2019)</ref>, i.e. a combination of information available in the database that reveals an occurrence of a medical event. For instance, a patient having a lower limbs doppler ultrasonography exam and few days after a delivery of anticoagulant drugs for 3 to 6 or 12 months is probably suffering from VTE. As MADB record medical exam and drugs deliveries, the above description may be used as a proxy of VTE.</p><p>The Semantic Web offers a relevant framework for representing complex data patterns and linking them with domain knowledge. Semantic Web data language (e.g. RDF) is suitable to represent structured data of MADB <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Rivault et al., 2019)</ref>. Moreover, linking raw data to standard medical taxonomies is interesting to enrich the description of cares with formalized expert knowledge (for instance, ICD-10 1 for diagnosis or ATC 2 for drugs). Once care trajectories have been represented in standard Semantic Web format, <software ContextAttributes="used">SPARQL</software> query engines can be used to enumerate all situations that match a query. A query can be seen as a phenotype. However, if the expressiveness of <software ContextAttributes="used">SPARQL</software> is interesting to specify complex care trajectories as a phenotype, the drawback is their com-putation time. In the following, we assume the reader to be familiar with RDF and <software ContextAttributes="used">SPARQL</software>, but a thorough introduction to semantic web can be found in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Hitzler et al., 2009)</ref>. The example of VTE illustrates that such query may be a complex arrangement of cares in a patient care trajectory. These arrangement involve temporal relations between events (quantitative delays). Thus, we are interested in specifying complex temporal patterns that may occur in care trajectories. Taking into account numerical filters in metric temporal constraints is not efficient in <software ContextAttributes="used">SPARQL</software> queries, and we can not expect to achieve reasonable computational efficiency on large MADB.</p><p>This article addresses the problem of enumerating the occurrences of a complex temporal pattern in a dataset of care trajectories.</p><p>We focus on a class of temporal patterns called chronicles and propose a template of <software ContextAttributes="used">SPARQL</software> query that is both expressive and efficient. A chronicle is an expressive temporal pattern. It is defined as a set of events linked with temporal constraints. Despite its lack of taxonomy handling, this temporal model is suitable to represent complex temporal care pathways. One of its interests is its efficiently to be recognized in a sequence of events <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dousson and Le Maigat, 2007)</ref>.</p><p>Our contribution is threefold: (i) we show how chronicles can be encoded as <software>SPARQL</software> queries to enumerate all their occurrences in a sequence of events represented in RDF; (ii) we propose <software ContextAttributes="used">HYCOR</software>, an hybrid method combining the expressiveness of Semantic Web and the efficiency of a pattern occurrence enumeration algorithm; (iii) we evaluate <software ContextAttributes="used">HYCOR</software> on a real case study of enumerating VTE events in the French MADB.</p></div>
<div><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>In this section, we review some approaches to enumerate occurrences of temporal patterns in sequences of events and their connection to Semantic Web.</p><p>Temporal databases and querying tools (Snodgrass and llsoo Ahn, 1986) address a part of the problem by extending the notion of database to timestamped data. They cover data representation problems but also specific querying language problems. This family encompasses the temporal extension of relational databases (e.g. TSQL) but also Semantic Web approaches which combine query language (<software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software>) extended to temporal data with Allen's relations <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Wang et al., 2010)</ref>. These approaches defines relative temporal constraints between intervals which are not relevant for the MADB query problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Pacaci et al., 2018)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Rivault et al. (Rivault et al., 2019)</ref> used RDF to represent care trajectories and shown that querying care trajectories can be achieved with the <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> query language. Semantic Web is a relevant approach for our problem: it does not explicitly address the problem of timed queries, but it is relevant to deal with data representation and taxonomies querying. RDF also enables ontology management with OWL based on the Description Logic (DL) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Baader et al., 2003)</ref> allowing ontology-mediated query answering (OMQA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bienvenu, 2016)</ref>. For instance, O'Connor et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(O'Connor et al., 2009)</ref> developed a tool based on OWL for research data management with a temporal reasoning in a clinical trial system. This aspect could be added to the presented method. Some approaches proposed to extend RDF/<software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> with temporal queries in a generic way. For instance, Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Zhang et al., 2019)</ref> propose <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software>[t] and <software ContextAttributes="created">EP-SPARQL</software> <ref type="bibr">(Anicic et al., 2011a)</ref> which is a <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> extension of event processing. Finally, ON-TOP is an ontology-based data access framework that has been extended for temporal data <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Kalayci et al., 2019)</ref>. However, these generic tools turn out to lack practical efficiency. This calls for investigating more algorithmic solutions.</p><p>Several temporal models have been highlighted in literature, one of the most promising is the Complex Event Processing (CEP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Giatrakos et al., 2017)</ref> which aims at processing a stream of event logs with patterns. CEP processes these logs to detect or to locate complex events (or patterns) defined by the user. These models emphasis on the effectiveness of processing and the expressivity of patterns. Some expressive formalisms, e.g. ETALIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Anicic et al., 2011b)</ref> or logic-based event recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Giatrakos et al., 2017)</ref> propose very expressive representations of complex events, including reasoning techniques (encompassing ontologies).</p><p>While the complex event descriptions of ETALIS are based on Allen's logic, temporal constraint networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cabalar et al., 2000)</ref> and Chronicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Dousson and Le Maigat, 2007)</ref> propose complex event descriptions with more permissive temporal constraints. These temporal models are also interesting for their graphical representation, but are restricted to patterns which do not involve taxonomies. It has been mainly used to discover patterns in biomedical data <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Dauxais et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Sahuguède et al., 2018)</ref> or in logs of industrial processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Sellami et al., 2018)</ref>.</p><p>In this work, we adopt a longitudinal view of a MADB. Each patient is represented by a sequence of timestamped cares, so called events. We first introduce the definition of event and taxonomy of event labels. Then, we introduce the notion of temporal sequence of events, or sequence for short.</p><p>Formally, an event is a pair (e,t) where e is an event label and t ∈ N is a timestamp (in days). In the following, (E, ≤ E ) denotes the totally ordered set of events. Usually, labels of medical events are related to taxonomies such as ATC 2 for drugs or ICD-10 1 for diseases.</p><p>Definition 1 (Event taxonomy). An event taxonomy is an ordered set of equivalence relations</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">(R i ) i∈[n] ,</formula><p>where n is the number of levels of the taxonomy, such that: ∀(i, j), i &lt; j, ∀(e, e ) ∈ E, eR j e =⇒ eR i e .

By extension, c ∈ C is a c ∈ C, denoted c c iff e c ⇒ e c for all e ∈ E.

Note that several events can have the same label. A chronicle event may also have its label belonging to the equivalent class of another event label. In these cases, Eq. 2 enforces event occurrences to be ordered by their index.</p><p>The Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates graphically the following 4sized chronicle C = (E, T ): id Sequence s 1 (A01AA01, 1), (B01AA01, 3), (A01AB14, 4), (C01AA01, 5), (C02AC01, 6), (D01AA01, 7) s 2 (B01AA01, 2), (D01AA01, 4), (A01AA01, 5), (C01AA01, 7) s 3 (A03AA01, 1), (B01AA01, 4), (C01AA01, 5), (B01AA01, 6), (C01AA01, 8), (D01AA01, 9) s 4 (B01AA01, 4), (A01AB14, 6), (N01AA01, 8), (C01AA01, 9) s 5 (B01AA01, 1), (A01AA01, 3), (C01AA01, 4) s 6 (C01AA01, 4), (B01AA01, 5), (A01AA01, 6), (C01AA01, 7), (D01AA01, 10)</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">• E = {(A01, 1), (B01A, 2), (C, 3), (C, 4)} • T = {(A01, 1)[-1, 3](B01A, 2) , (A01, 1)[-3, 5](C, 3) , (B01A, 2)[-2, 2](C, 3) , (C, 3)[1, 3](C, 4)}</formula><p>where event labels belong to the ATC taxonomy. Notice that temporal constraints may have negative values. The temporal constraint (A01, 1)[-3, 5](C, 3) states that an event with label in the equivalence class of A01 must occur from 3 days before occurrence of a C to 5 days after this occurrence. Thus, the chronicle Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> means: "An event A01 is followed by an event B01A within a delay of [-1, 3] units of time (ut). The later is followed by an event C within a delay of [-2, 2] ut. In addition the delay between this event C and the event labeled A01 must be in <ref type="bibr">[-3, 5]</ref> ut. Finally, C event is followed by an another event C within a delay of [1, 3] ut".</p><p>In the following, we introduce the definition of a chronicle occurrence in a sequence. Then, one can be interested in two different tasks: enumerating all occurrences of a chronicle in a sequence (chronicle enumeration), or deciding whether a chronicle occurs at least once in the sequence (chronicle recognition). In the following, we focus on the chronicle enumeration task. Definition 4 (Chronicle occurrence). Let s = (e 1 ,t 1 ), (e 2 ,t 2 ), . . . , (e n ,t n ) be a sequence of length n and</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">C = (E = {(c 1 , 1), . . . , (c m , m)}, T ) be a chronicle of size m over a set of labels (E, ≤ E , ). An occurrence of C in s is a subsequence of s of length m, denoted s = (e ε 1 ,t ε 1 ), . . . , (c ε m ,t ε m ) , where (ε i ) i=1..m are indices of an event in s and s.t. 1. e ε i c i 2. t ε j -t ε i ∈ [t -,t + ] whenever (c i , i)[t -,t + ](c j , j) ∈ T . (ε i ) i=1..m</formula><p>describes s a subsequence of s. The first condition ensures that the i-th event label of s is a subclass of c i . The second condition ensures that temporal constraints are satisfied. Note that Eq. 2 enforces to have a strict order between events c k , c j whenever c k c j . Thus, all ε i , i ∈ [1, n] are distinct. The chronicle of Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> occurs in sequences s 1 and s 6 of the dataset in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>. For instance, {(A01AA01, 1), (B01AA01, 3), (C01AA01, 5), (C02AC01, 6)} is an occurrence of C in s 1 . This occurrence is the subsequence of s 1 with indices 1, 2, 4, 5 . The chronicle does not occur in s 2 neither in s 4 because of unsatisfied temporal constraints. It does not occur in s 5 as there is only one event with a type of class C in the sequence and the chronicle requires two different events. It does not occur in s 3 because there is not an event in the subgroup of A01.</p></div>

<div><head n="6">Experiments</head><p>In this section, we compare execution times of <software>SPARQL</software> and <software ContextAttributes="used">HYCOR</software> on synthetic datasets. All experiments have been executed with a TDB-graph format for RDF and Jena-Fuseki as <software ContextAttributes="used">SPARQL</software> engine. The <software ContextAttributes="used">HYCOR</software> algorithm is implemented in Python. The computer has 16Go RAM and an SSD.</p></div>
<div><head n="6.1">Synthetic datasets generation and plan of experiments</head><p>Several synthetic datasets have been generated. Each dataset contains a set of sequences where event labels are randomly chosen at the lowest level of ATC taxonomy. The ATC taxonomy contains 1 900 classes.</p><p>In addition, occurrences of ten 15-sized chronicles 3 are embedded in the dataset. For each chronicle, a constraint is generated for each pair of events without inconsistency between the temporal constraints.</p><p>3 A n-sized-chronicle denotes a chronicle of size n.</p><p>The synthetic dataset generation process ensures that each chronicle occurs in about 20% of the sequences. Chronicles contain event labels from several levels of ATC following this probability: 1 15 level 1 (ex: N), 2 15 level 2 (ex: N02), 3 15 level 3 (ex: N02B), 3 15 level 4 (ex: N02BE), 6 15 level 5 (ex: N02BE01). We introduce the notation D ns,ne to denote a synthetic dataset with ns sequences and ne care events per sequence (all sequences have the same number of events). For the following experiments, 25 synthetic datasets have been generated where ns ∈ {1 000, 5 000, 10 000, 15 000, 20 000} and ne ∈ {100, 200, 300, 400, 500}. Each dataset is encoded in RDF. The ATC taxonomy is attached to the dataset.</p></div>
<div><head n="6.2">Experiments and Results</head><p>The following experiments evaluate the impact of two main parameters on execution times of <software>SPARQL</software> and <software ContextAttributes="used">HYCOR</software>: the size of the dataset (number of sequences and number of events per sequence) and the chronicle size.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref> compares the execution times of <software ContextAttributes="used">SPARQL</software> and <software ContextAttributes="used">HYCOR</software> with respect to the length of the sequences. It shows that <software ContextAttributes="used">HYCOR</software> is at least one order of magnitude more efficient than pure <software ContextAttributes="used">SPARQL</software>. 6 shows that <software ContextAttributes="used">SPARQL</software> does not scale up for datasets containing more than 50 000 sequences. The <software ContextAttributes="used">HYCOR</software> <software ContextAttributes="used">SPARQL</software> query language does not have the same limitation. Indeed, the pure <software ContextAttributes="used">SPARQL</software> query uses filters to deal with temporal constraints on each admissible event while <software ContextAttributes="used">SPARQL</software> <software ContextAttributes="used">HYCOR</software> query only uses values to find admissible event. So, the use of filters on a large scale of admissible events seems to be inefficient in <software ContextAttributes="used">SPARQL</software> for this kind of use.</p><p>We also evaluate the part of <software>HYCOR</software> execution times spent by the <software ContextAttributes="used">SPARQL</software> mapping and the chronicle enumeration algorithm. On average, the <software ContextAttributes="used">SPARQL</software> query execution represents 85% ± 3.47 of the total execution time.</p><p>Experiments now focus on the <software ContextAttributes="used">HYCOR</software> evaluation. Fig. <ref type="figure">7</ref> illustrates the impact of the number of events per sequence on the execution times. We observe that time increases linearly with the number of events and with the number of sequences. Outliers and variance of the computing time can be explained by the variability of the number of events occurrences in the sequence that influence the time execution of the Algorithm 2. The more an event occurs in a sequence, the more candidate occurrences, therefore the longer the time spent in the algorithm. Nonetheless, we can notice in the hardest condition: D 20 000,500 , enumeration of a chronicle with 15 events takes in average less than a minute. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">8</ref> presents execution time of <software ContextAttributes="used">HYCOR</software> wrt chronicle size. <software ContextAttributes="used">HYCOR</software> is run on a unique dataset (ns = 10 000 and ne = 100) and seven sets of 10 chronicles with sizes 2 to 14. We observe execution time linearly increases with the chronicle size.</p><p><software>HYCOR</software> outperforms pure-<software ContextAttributes="used">SPARQL</software> for the chronicle enumeration task. Its execution time increases with the chronicle sizes and the dataset size, but it still offers impressive results for large datasets.</p><p>7 Use case on the SNDS to find patients with thromboembolism</p><p>Our use case proposes to find patients diagnosed with venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the SNDS. The SNDS is the french national health insurance database, which covers most of the french population (above 65 million inhabitants). The advantage of this database is to gather information about most the reimbursed medical events, from drug deliveries to nurse home cares, specialist consultations, etc. The range of medical events that are recorded in the database makes it suitable to conduct a wide variety of health studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Tuppin et al., 2017)</ref>. However, SNDS has been designed for administrative purposes (care reimbursements) and does not contain detailed medical information such as medical reports, laboratory results or diagnosis. This use case uses a geographical-based SNDS subset (the north western French Brittany population) which contains 377 359 individuals. For the use case application, rdf:type have been added in the RDF event triples to speed up access to event labels. We used five different types: DrugDeliveries (e.g., drug deliveries from pharmacy), Cares (e.g., nurse assistance, domestic assistance), Medical acts (e.g., radiology, surgery), Biologies (e.g., blood withdrawal), Hospitalisations.</p><p>VTE is identified by epidemiologists in SNDS when a patient matches the following description:</p><p>In clinical practice facing a suspicion of VTE physicians first prescribe anticoagulant and then confirm or not the diagnosis through specific medical acts: e.g. Doppler ultrasonography or CT scan. Patients with suspected PE are often hospitalized whereas patients with suspected DVT are managed on an ambulatory basis. If the suspicion is confirmed, anticoagulant deliveries continues for 3 to 12 months (once per month) or sometimes longer duration. Hence, the diagnosis (through medical act) is preceded or followed by anticoagulant initiation within a time window of at most 0 to 7 days, keeping in mind that PE suspicion leads to hospitalisation during which medical acts to confirm the diagnosis are performed and then anticoagulant delivery is observed only after the patient comes back home. Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">9</ref> illustrates two chronicles defining the phenotype of "patients with VTE". Each chronicle specifies temporal constraints (within 7 days and one anticoagulant delivery per month) but also takes into account some details on the anti-coagulant class and on the medical acts on ambulatory or in hospital. Anticoagulant are identified with the ATC code B01. We also added to the knowledge base a class named ccam:thrombose which is defined as an union of 36 different codes of medical acts issued of the CCAM taxonomy 4 . Furthermore, some VTE are identified in hospital through ICD-10 codes 1 , they are gathered in a class called cim:diagthrombose.</p><p>For this experiment, we load RDF graphs, we query them with both chronicles, one by one, and evaluate computing time. Note that we do not have the ground truth. Thus, we are not interested in the accuracy of the chronicles to identify true VTE. In this experiments, we compare the computational efficiency to enumerate the same set of VTE occurrences.</p><p>The first result is that the corresponding pure-<software ContextAttributes="used">SPARQL</software> query does not finish the enumeration within a day of computation. This is due to the scale up limitation shown in Sect. 5.2. <software ContextAttributes="used">HYCOR</software> finds 2 686 patients having VTE in 105.06s. The first chronicle finds 2 568 patients in 56.21s (of which 52.86s in algorithm execution), the second chronicle finds 118 patients in 48.85s (of which 48.46s in algorithm execution). Use case time execution is even faster than expected by experiments on synthetic data. The real patient sequences length is about 100 events in average. So if we refer to Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>, on the right, the expected execution time is about 11min41s. We explain this difference by the lower size of the chronicles in our use case query.</p><p>4 CCAM : common classification of medical acts used by the french social security</p></div>
<div><head n="8">Conclusion</head><p>In this article, we extended the model of chronicle with taxonomies to enumerate complex temporal patterns in sequences. This problem is motivated by the need for phenotyping patients in medicoadministrative databases. We proposed <software>HYCOR</software>, an hybrid approach that combines the expressiveness of <software ContextAttributes="used">SPARQL</software> and the efficiency of a dedicated algorithm. The results show that <software ContextAttributes="used">HYCOR</software> is one order of magnitude faster than pure <software ContextAttributes="used">SPARQL</software> queries on both synthetic and real dataset. As a perspective, chronicles should be extended with negation to denote the absence of event. Furthermore, it could be interesting to compare the efficiency of different <software ContextAttributes="used">SPARQL</software> engines.  </p></div><figure xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Chronicle example with 4 events (vertices) and 4 temporal constraints (edges with temporal intervals).
