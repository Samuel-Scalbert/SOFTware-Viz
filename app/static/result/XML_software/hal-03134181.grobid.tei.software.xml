<div><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In recent years we have witnessed the success of graph representation learning in many tasks such as community detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">8]</ref>, link prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20]</ref>, graph classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and cascade growth prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>. A large body of work has focused on node embeddings, techniques that represent nodes as dense vectors that preserve the properties of nodes in the original graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">5]</ref>. Representation learning of larger structures has generally been associated with embedding collections of graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. Paths, subgraphs and communities embeddings have received far less attention despite their importance in graphs. In homogeneous graphs, subgraph embeddings have been used in community prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1]</ref>, and cascade growth prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6]</ref>. In heterogeneous graphs, subgraphs embedding have tackled tasks such as semantic user search <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref> and question answering <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>.</p><p>Nevertheless, the techniques proposed in the literature for computing subgraph embeddings have at least one of the following two drawbacks: i ) they are supervised techniques and such they are dependent on annotated data and do not generalize to other tasks; ii ) they can tackle only a specific type of subgraph.</p><p>Part of this work was done while the authors were at Max Planck Institute for Informatics, Germany.</p><p>Approach. In this work, we tackle the problem of computing subgraph embeddings in an unsupervised setting, where embeddings are trained for one task and will be tested on different tasks. We propose a subgraph embedding method based on a novel subgraph proximity measure. Our measure is inspired by the random walk proximity measure Personalized <software ContextAttributes="used">PageRank</software> <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>. We show that our subgraph embeddings are comprehensive and achieve competitive performance on three important data mining tasks: community detection, link prediction, and cascade growth prediction.</p></div>
<div><head>Contributions. Our salient contributions in this work are:</head><p>• We define a novel subgraph to subgraph proximity measure;</p><p>• We introduce a framework that learns comprehensive subgraphs embeddings;</p><p>• In a thorough experimental evaluation, we highlight the potential of our method on a variety of data mining tasks.</p></div>
<div><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Node embeddings. Methods for computing node embeddings aim to represent nodes as low-dimensional vectors that summarize properties of nodes, such as their neighborhood. The numerous embedding techniques differ in the computational model and in what properties of nodes are conserved. For example, in matrix factorization approaches, the goal is to perform dimension reduction on a matrix that encodes the pairwise proximity of nodes, where proximity is defined as adjacency <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, k-step transitions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>, or Katz centrality <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>. Random walk approaches have been inspired by the important progress achieved in the NLP community in computing word embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>. These techniques optimize node embeddings such that nodes co-occurring in short random walks in the graph have similar embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10]</ref>. Another successful technique is to take as input a node and an embedding similarity distribution and minimizes the KL-divergence between the two distributions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20]</ref>.</p><p>Subgraph embeddings. A natural follow-up question is how to compute embeddings for larger structures in the graph, such as paths, arbitrary subgraphs, motifs or communities. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, the authors propose a method inspired by <software ContextAttributes="used">Para-graphVector</software> <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>, where each subgraph is represented as a collection of random walks. Subgraph and node embeddings are learned such that given a subgraph and a random walk, we can predict the next node in the walk using the subgraph embedding and the node embeddings. The approach is tested on link prediction and on community detection, using ego-networks to represent nodes. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>, the authors present an end-to-end neural framework that given in input the cascade graph, predicts the future growth of the cascade for a given time period. A cascade graph is sampled for a set of random walks, which are given as input to a gated neural network to predict the future size of the cascade. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref> is similarly an end-to-end neural framework for cascade prediction, but based on the Hawkes process. The method transforms the cascade into diffusion paths, where each path describes the process of information propagation within the observation time-frame. Another very important type of subgraph is a community and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref> community embeddings are represented as multivariate Gaussian distributions.</p><p>Graph embeddings. Given a collection of graphs, a graph embedding technique will learn representations for each graph. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the authors propose an inductive framework for computing graph embeddings, based on training an attention network to predict a graph proximity measure, such as graph edit distance. Graph embeddings are closely related to graph kernels, functions that measure the similarity between pairs of graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>. Graph kernels are used together with kernel methods such as SVM to perform graph classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>.</p><p>3 Feature Learning Framework</p><p>Preliminaries. <software ContextAttributes="used">PageRank</software> <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref> is the stationary distribution of a random walk in which, at a given step, with a probability α, a surfer teleports to a random node and with probability 1 -α, moves along a randomly chosen outgoing edge of the current node. In Personalized <software ContextAttributes="used">PageRank</software> (PPR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>, instead of teleporting to a random node with probability α, the surfer teleports to a randomly chosen node from a set of predefined seed nodes. Let P r(u) be the <software ContextAttributes="used">PageRank</software> of node u and P P R(u, v) be the <software ContextAttributes="used">PageRank</software> score of node v personalized for seed node u.</p><p>Problem statement. Given a directed graph G = (V, E), a set of subgraphs S 1 , S 2 , • • • , S k of G and an integer d, compute the d-dimensional embeddings of the subgraphs.</p></div>
<div><head n="3.1">Subgraph Proximity Measure</head><p>We define a subgraph proximity measure inspired by Personalized <software>PageRank</software>. Let S i and S j be two subgraphs in a directed graph G. Their proximity in the graph is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">px(S i , S j ) = vi∈Si P R Si (v i ) vj ∈Sj P R Sj (v j ) • P P R(v i , v j ),<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where P R Si (v i ) represents the <software>PageRank</software> of node v i in the subgraph S i , and</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">P P R(v i , v j ) the PageRank of node v j personalized for node v i in the graph G.</formula><p>When considering how to define proximity between subgraphs, our intuition is as follows: important nodes in subgraph S i should be close to important nodes in subgraph S j . This condition is fulfilled as <software>PageRank</software> will give high scores to important nodes in the subgraphs and Personalized <software ContextAttributes="used">PageRank</software> will give high scores to nodes that are "close" or "similar". We note that our measure is a similarity measure, hence subgraphs that are similar will receive a high proximity score. We choose the term proximity to emphasis that our measure relates to nearness in the graph, as it is computed using random walks.</p><p>We can interpret Eq. 1 using random walks, as follows: Alice is a random surfer in the subgraph S i , Bob is a random surfer in the subgraph S j , and Carol is a random surfer in graph G. Alice decides to send a message to Bob via Carol. Carol starts from the current node Alice is visiting (P R Si (v i )) and she will reach a node v j ∈ S j with probability P P R(v i , v j ). Bob will be there to receive the message with probability P R Sj (v j ).</p></div>
<div><head>Normalized proximity. Given a collection of subgraphs</head><formula xml:id="formula_2">S = {S 1 , S 2 , • • • S k },</formula><p>we normalize the proximity px(S i , S j ), ∀j ∈ 1, k such that it can be interpreted as a probability distribution. The normalized proximity for a subgraph S i is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">px(S i , S j ) = px(S i , S j ) S k ∈S px(S i , S k ) (2)</formula><p>Rank of a subgraph. Similarly to <software>PageRank</software>, our proximity can inform us of the importance of a subgraph. The normalized proximity given a collection of subgraphs S 1 , S 2 , • • • S k can be expressed as a stochastic matrix, where each row i encodes the normalized proximity given subgraph S i . The importance of subgraph S i can be computed by summing up the elements of column i.</p><p>Sampling according to the proximity measure. Given a subgraph S i in input, we present a procedure for efficiently sampling px(S i , •) introduced in Eq. 1. We suppose that all the Pagerank vectors of the subgraphs {S 1 , S 2 , • • • S k } have been precomputed. We first select a node n i in S i according to distribution P R Si . Secondly, we start a random walk from n i in the graph G and we select n j , the last node in the walk before the teleportation. Lastly, node n j may belong to several subgraphs S j 1 , S j 2 • • •. We return a subgraph S j according to the normalized distribution P R S j 1 (n j ), P R S j 2 (n j ), • • •. The procedure doesn't require computing the Personalized Pagerank vectors, which saves us O(n 2 ) space. We shall use this procedure for computing embeddings, thus avoiding computing and storing the full proximity measure px.</p></div>
<div><head n="3.2">Subgraph Embeddings via SubRank</head><p>Given a graph G = (V, E) and set of subgraphs of G, S = {S 1 , S 2 , • • • , S k }, we learn their representations as dense vectors, i.e. as embeddings. We extend the framework in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref> proposed for computing node embeddings to an approach for subgraph embeddings. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>, the authors propose to learn node embeddings such that the embeddings preserve an input similarity distribution between nodes. The similarities of a node v to any other node in the graph are represented by the similarity distribution sim G , where w∈V sim G (v, w) = 1. The corresponding embedding similarity distribution is sim E . The optimization function of the learning algorithm minimizes the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the two proximity distributions:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">v∈V KL(sim G (v, •), sim E (v, •))</formula><p>The authors propose several options for instantiating sim G , such as Personalized <software>PageRank</software> and adjacency similarity. The similarity between embeddings, sim E , is the normalized dot product of the vectors.</p><p>In order to adapt this approach to our case, we define the subgraph-tosubgraph proximity sim G to be the normalized proximity presented in Eq. 2. The embedding similarity sim E is computed in the same manner and the optimization function now minimizes the divergence between distributions defined on our input subgraphs, i.e. sim G , sim E : S × S → [0, 1]. In our experimental evaluation we use this method, which we refer to as <software>SubRank</software>. We note that sim G will not be fully computed, but approximated using the sampling procedure presented in Section 3.1.</p></div>
<div><head n="3.3">Applications</head><p>Proximity of ego-networks. Two very important tasks in graph mining are community detection and link prediction. Suppose Alice is a computer scientist and she joins Twitter. She starts following the updates of Andrew Ng, but also the updates of her friends, Diana and John. Bob is also a computer scientist on Twitter and he follows Andrew Ng, Jure Leskovec and his friend Julia. As shown in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, there is no path in the directed graph between Alice and Bob. A pathbased similarity measure between nodes Alice and Bob, such as Personalized <software ContextAttributes="created">PageRank</software>, will return similarity 0, while it will return high values between Alice and Andrew Ng and between Bob and Andrew Ng. An optimization algorithm for computing node embeddings will have to address this trade-off, with a potential loss in the quality of the representations. Thus, we might miss that both Alice and Bob are computer scientists. To address this issue we capture the information stored in the neighbors of the nodes by considering ego-networks. Therefore in our work, we represent a node v as its ego network of size k (the nodes reachable from v in k steps). In Section 4, we perform quantitative analysis to validate our intuition.</p><p>Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>: Illustrative example for ego-network proximity.</p><p>Proximity of cascade subgraphs. In a graph, an information cascade can be modeled as a directed tree, where the root represents the original content creator, and the remaining nodes represent the content reshares. When considering the task of predicting the future size of the cascade, the nodes already in the cascade are important, as it very likely their neighbors will be affected by the information propagation. However, nodes that have reshared more recently the information are more visible to their neighbors. When running <software>PageRank</software> on a directed tree, we observe that nodes on the same level have the same score, and the score of nodes increases as we increase the depth. Hence, two cascade trees will have a high proximity score px if nodes that have joined later the cascades (i.e. are on lower levels in the trees) are "close" or "similar" according to Personalized Pagerank. In Section 5, we perform quantitative analysis and we show that our approach gives better results than a method that gives equal importance to all nodes in the cascade.</p></div>

The running times are as follows: 1m40s Citeseer, 1m26s Cora, 49s Polblogs, 19m39s for Cithep and 39m45s for DBLP.</p></div>
<div><head n="4.1">Node Clustering</head><p>We assess the quality of the embeddings in terms of their ability to capture communities in a graph. For this, we use the k-means algorithm to cluster the nodes embedded in the d-dimensional space. In Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">2</ref>  </p></div>
<div><head n="4.2">Node Classification</head><p>Node classification is the task of predicting the correct node labels in a graph.</p><p>For each dataset, we try several configurations by varying the percentage of nodes used in training. We evaluate the methods using the micro and macro F 1 score, and we report the micro F 1, as both measures present similar trends. The results are presented in Table <ref type="table">3</ref>. On Citeseer and Cora <software ContextAttributes="used">SubRank</software> significantly outperforms the other methods.

On DBLP, <software ContextAttributes="used">SubRank</software> is the second best method.</p></div>
<div><head n="4.3">Link prediction</head><p>To create training data for link prediction, we randomly remove 10% of edges, ensuring that each node retains at least one neighbor. This set represents the ground truth in the test set, while we take the remaining graph as the training set. In addition, we randomly sample an equal number of node pairs that have no edge connecting them as negative samples in our test set. We then learn embeddings on the graph without the 10% edges. Next, for each edge (u, v) in the training or the test set, we obtain the edge features by computing the Hadamard product of the embeddings for u and v. The Hadamard product has shown a better performance than other operators for this task <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20]</ref>.

<div><head n="5">Feature Learning for Information Cascades</head><p>Given in input: i ) a social network G = (V, E), captured at a time t 0 , ii ) a set of information cascades C that appear in G after the timestamp t 0 , and that are captured after t 1 duration from their creation, iii ) a time window t 2 , our goal is to predict the growth of a cascade, i.e. the number of new nodes a cascade acquires, at t 1 + t 2 time from its creation. Note that given a cascade</p><p>• In addition, we consider the node embedding method <software ContextAttributes="used">VERSE</software> <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>, as one of the top-performing baseline in the previous section. The node embeddings are learned on the original graph and a cascade is represented as the average of the embeddings of the nodes it contains. We then train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) regressor to predict the growth of the cascade.</p><p>Parameter setting for SubRank. We recall that our subgraph proximity measure requires the computation of PPR of nodes in the graph and the PR of nodes in the subgraphs. For this task, we consider the PPR of nodes in the global graph and the PR of nodes in the cascades. We obtain the cascade embeddings which are then used to train an MLP regressor. For both <software>VERSE</software> and <software ContextAttributes="used">SubRank</software> we perform a grid search for the optimal parameters of the regressor.</p><p>We report the mean squared error (MSE) on the logarithm of the cascade growth value, as done in previous work on cascade prediction <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6]</ref> in Table <ref type="table">5</ref>. We observe that <software ContextAttributes="used">SubRank</software> out-performs <software ContextAttributes="used">VERSE</software> thus corroborating our intuition that nodes appearing later in a cascade should be given more importance. The best MSE overall is obtained by the end-to-end framework <software ContextAttributes="used">DeepHawkes</software> which is expected as the method is tailored for the task. We note, however, that <software ContextAttributes="used">SubRank</software> achieves the best results on <software ContextAttributes="used">AMiner</software>.</p></div>
<div><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>In this work, we introduce a new measure of proximity for subgraphs and a framework for computing subgraph embeddings. In a departure from previous work, we focus on general-purpose embeddings, and we shed light on why our method is suited for several data mining tasks. Our experimental evaluation shows that the subgraph embeddings achieve competitive performance on three downstream applications: community detection, link prediction, and cascade prediction.</p></div><figure type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>•</head><label /><figDesc>Polblogs 4 is a directed network of hyperlinks between political blogs discussing US politics.

We set the parameters to the default given by the authors: the learning rate for user embeddings is 5 × 10 -4 and the learning rate for other variables is 5 × 10 -3 .</p></div>			</div>
