<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Dans le domaine de la fouille de motifs, un motif séquentiel négatif exprime un comportement par une séquence d'événements devant survenir et par des événements qui doivent être absents.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Pattern mining consists in exploring a set of potential patterns to output all but only the most interesting ones. The set of potential patterns can be seen as a search space and the notion of pattern interestingness can be seen as a set of constraints.</p><p>The search space in which lies the potential patterns defines a pattern domain. A large number of pattern domains have been proposed in the pattern mining community. The most studied patterns domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> are: itemsets, sequential patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref> and graph patterns. But a lot of variants from these patterns domains have been proposed. As we focus our attention on temporal data, we can mention: temporal patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref>, episodes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> or chronicles <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</p><p>The notion of interestingness studied in pattern mining often refers to the number of its occurrences in a database. A pattern is said to be interesting if it occurs frequently in a dataset of examples (frequent sequential pattern mining task). In practice, a pattern is frequent if its number of occurrences is above a user-defined threshold. Therefore, counting sequences in which the pattern occurs is of paramount importance. It is strongly related to the containment relation which decides whether a pattern occurs in a sequence or not. The support measure denotes the counting of sequences in a dataset D that contains the pattern p, denoted supp D (p).</p><p>The success of pattern mining techniques comes from an anti-monotonicity property of some support measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Intuitively, if p is not frequent, no "larger" pattern than p is frequent. The pattern mining trick is to prune the search space as soon as an unfrequent pattern as been found. The "is larger than" relation is a topological structure on the set of patterns. As soon as a support measure is antimonotonic on this topological structure, the frequent pattern mining trick can be used to efficiently prune the search space. Ideally, this structure is a lattice. In this case, the above strategy is complete and correct.</p><p>It is worth noticing that the support measure strongly contributes to the semantic of the interestingness of patterns. In fact, output patterns depend on their supports in the dataset(s) of examples. Different support measures have different outputs. For instance, in sequential pattern mining, counting occurrences considering gap constraints does not result in the same set of patterns. 1   In this work, we explore the domain of negative sequential patterns. Sequential patterns describe a sequence of items. The pattern occurs in a sequence while its items appear in the same order in a sequence. For instance, a pattern a b c is read as "a occurs and then b occurs and finally c occurs". Negative sequential patterns are sequential patterns with the specification of absent events. Intuitively, the syntax of a negative sequential pattern will be the following a ¬b c . This pattern is read as "a occurs and then c occurs, but b does not occurs in between".</p><p>The apparently intuitive notion of absent event appears to be complex. Few approaches explored what seems to be the same pattern domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref>. They use the similar notation of negation (¬) but this unique syntax is hiding different semantics.</p><p>In this article, we bring the light on eight different semantics of negative sequential patterns and we study them formally: we introduce dominance and equivalence relations between these semantics, and we establish antimonotony results to thwart the idea that negative sequential patterns are not anti-monotonic.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Negative sequential patterns</head><p>In the sequel, [n] = {1, . . . , n} denotes the set of the first n strictly positive integers. Let I be the set of items (alphabet). An itemset A = {a 1 a 2 ... a m } ⊆ I is a set of items. A sequence s is a set of sequentially ordered itemsets s = s 1 s 2 ... s n : ∀i, j ∈ [n], i &lt; j means that s i is located before s j in sequence s which starts by s 1 and finishes by s n .</p><p>Definition 1 (Negative sequential patterns (NSP)).

It can be noticed that Definition 1 introduces a syntactic limitation on negative sequential patterns:</p><p>-a pattern cannot start neither finish by a negative pattern, -a pattern cannot have two successive negative itemsets.</p><p>Example 1 (Negative sequential pattern). This example illustrates notations of Definition 1. Let I = {a, b, c, d} and p = a ¬(bc) (ad) d ¬(ab) d . We have p 1 = {a}, p 2 = {ad}, p 3 = {d}, p 4 = {d} and q 1 = {bc}, q 2 = ∅, q 3 = {ab}. The length of p is | p| = 6 and p + = a (ad) d d .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Semantics of negative sequential patterns</head><p>The semantics of negative sequential patterns relies on negative containment: a sequence s supports pattern p (or p matches the sequence s) iff s contains a sub-sequence s such that every positive itemset of p is included in some itemset of s in the same order and for any negative itemset ¬q i of p, q i is not included in any itemset occurring in the sub-sequence of s located between the occurrence of the positive itemset preceding ¬q i in p and the occurrence of the positive itemset following ¬q i in p.</p><p>Definition 2 (Non inclusion). We introduce two operators relating two itemsets P ⊆ I \ ∅ and I ⊆ I:</p><p>-partial non inclusion: P I ⇔ ∃e ∈ P, e I -total non inclusion: P I ⇔ ∀e ∈ P, e I and, by convention, ∅ I and ∅ I for all I ⊆ I.</p><p>In the sequel we will denote the general form of itemset non inclusion by the symbol , meaning either or .</p><p>Intuitively, partial non inclusion considers the itemset as a disjunction of negative constraints, i.e. at least one of the item has to be absent, and total non-inclusion consider the itemset as a conjunction of negative constraints: all items have to be absent.</p><p>Choosing one non inclusion interpretation or the other has consequences on extracted patterns as well as on pattern search. Let's illustrate this with following sequence dataset:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D =                    s 1 = (bc) f a s 2 = (bc) (c f ) a s 3 = (bc) (d f ) a s 4 = (bc) (e f ) a s 5 = (bc) (cde f ) a                    .</formula><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> compares the support of patterns under the two semantics of itemset non-inclusion. Let's consider pattern p 2 on sequence s 2 . Considering that the positive part of p 2 is in s 2 , p 2 occurs in the sequence iff (cd) (c f ). In case of total non inclusion, it is false that (cd) (c f ) because of c that occurs in (c f ), and thus p 2 does not occur in s 2 . But in case of a partial non inclusion, it is true that (cd) (c f ), because of d that does not occur in (c f ), and thus p 2 occurs in s 2 . Lemma 1.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">2</ref> Let P, I ⊆ I be two itemsets:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P I =⇒ P I<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Now, we formulate the notions of sub-sequence, non inclusion and absence by means of the concept of embedding.</p><p>Table <ref type="table">1</ref> -Lists of supported sequences in D by negative patterns ( p i ) i=1..4 under the total and partial non inclusion semantics.

The soft embedding considers individually each of the sequence's itemsets of [e i +1, e i+1 -1] while strict embedding consider them as a whole. Notation 1. Soft-embedding is denoted -embedding, and strict-embedding is denoted -embedding. One can notice that each sequence contains a unique occurrence of a d , the positive part of pattern p. Using soft-embedding and partial non inclusion ( := ), p occurs in s 1 , s 3 and s 4 but not in s 2 . Using strict-embedding and partial non-inclusion, p occurs in sequence s 3 and s 4 . Indeed, items b and c occur between occurrences of a and d in sequences 1 and 2. With total non inclusion ( := ) and either type of embeddings, the absence of an itemset is satisfied if any of its item is absent. As a consequence, p occurs only in sequence s 4 .</p><p>Lemma 2.

Let p = p 1 ¬q 1 . . . ¬q n-1 p n ∈ N, if e is an embedding of pattern p in some sequence s, then e is an embedding of the positive sequential pattern p + in s.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Example 2 illustrates the impact of itemset noninclusion operator and of embedding type.</head><p>Another point that determines the semantics of negative containment concerns the multiple occurrences of some pattern in a sequence: should all or at least one occurrence(s) of the pattern positive part in the sequence satisfy the non inclusion constraints?

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Dominance and equivalence between containment relations</head><p>Definition 6 (Dominance). For all θ, θ ∈ Θ, θ dominates θ , denoted θ θ , iff pθs =⇒ pθ s for all p ∈ N and all sequence s.</p><p>The idea behind the dominance relation between two containment relations θ and θ is related to the sequences in which a pattern occurs. By definition, if θ θ then for any pattern p ∈ N, if p occurs in a sequence s according to the θ pattern containment relation, then it also occurs in s according to the θ pattern containment relation. In the context of pattern mining, such kinds of relation are useful to propose algorithms which could benefit from properties of a dominating containment relation to extract efficiently the patterns according to dominated containment relations. Notation 2. We denote by θ θ iff θ θ is false. Lemma 8. Dominance relation is a pre-order. Definition 7 (Equivalent containment relations). For all θ, θ ∈ Θ, θ is equivalent to θ , denoted θ ∼ θ iff θ θ and θ θ.</p><p>Lemma 9. ∼ is an equivalence relation on Θ.</p><p>Equivalent containment relations have the same semantic. The sets of sequences in which a given pattern occurs are the same and, reciprocally, the sets of negative patterns which occur in a sequence are the same considering these equivalent containment relations.</p><p>We now study the practical dominance relations we have between the elements of Θ.</p><p>Proposition 1. The following dominances between containment relations hold:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">(4) (5) (6) (7)</formula><p>and the following non-dominance statements hold:</p><p>(8) (9) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref> where ∈ , , ∈ { , } and ∈ { , }.</p><p>Proposition 1 gathers the results from the previous section. Each line expresses several relationships between pairs of containment relations. Equations 4-7 are dominances deduced from Lemmas 2, 3, 6 and 7. Equations 8-10 states the absence of dominance for which we can exhibit counterexamples. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> summarizes them. 3  In addition, many other dominance and non dominance relationships can be deduced from Proposition 1 using the transitivity of dominance (Lemma 8). Nonetheless, in this work, some relationships between pairs of containment relations can not be deduced from Proposition 1. For instance, the relationship between and is not determined by Proposition 1.</p><p>One interesting result of Proposition 1 is that there are two pairs of containment relations, , and , , whose elements are equivalent.</p><p>3. Assuming that two containment relations are not equals iff they are different, the dominance relation is a pre-order. The property is not central in the following. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref> illustrates clearly that it is not a partial order. Indeed, two pairs of different containment relations are symmetrically dominated. We can finally point out that Lemma 4 adds a dominance relation when negative sequential patterns are restricted to have singleton negative itemsets.

Let D = {s i } i∈[n] be a set of n sequences and p be a NSP. The support of p in D, denoted supp D θ (p) is the number of sequences of D in which p occurs according to the θ ∈ Θ containment relation. Notation 3. When there is no ambiguity on the dataset of sequences, supp D θ (p) is denoted supp θ (p).

On the one hand, the results from Proposition 6 can be directly used to implement algorithms with efficient and correct strategies to prune the search space. 8 For containment relation, Equation 16 fully exploits the partial order to early prune a priori unfrequent patterns. For containment relation, the + partial order must be used to ensure the correctness of the algorithm (Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_21">17</ref>).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Conclusion and perspectives</head><p>In this article, we explored the semantics of negation in sequential patterns. We gave eight possible semantics 8. The completeness of the algorithms requires to study how to traverse the search space. It is out of the scope of this article.</p><p>where the state of the art in sequential pattern mining did not notice these differences. We investigated the formal properties of these semantics: their respective relations (dominance and equivalence) and anti-monotonicity properties. These results may be used to develop new efficient algorithms to extract negative sequential patterns.</p><p>It is worth noticing that no semantics is "more" correct or relevant than another one. It depends on the information to be captured. Our objective is to give the opportunity to make an informed choice. Even if, in the context of pattern mining, the choice is constrained by computational considerations. With the three proposed partial orders, we have seen that interesting anti-monotonicity holds only for some semantics. Thus, dominance relations may be used to propose alternative search heuristics.</p><p>Hence, the first perspective of this work is to develop negative sequential pattern mining algorithms. This has been done for containment relations ≺ <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. 9 In this algorithm, we also introduced maxgap and maxspan constrains negative sequential patterns. The anti-mononicity properties still hold with these constraints. A step further, the framework presented in this article would make possible to propose a complete and correct algorithm to mine closed NSP.</p><p>Our second perspective is to provide a complete results on the dominance between containment relations. There are still few cases that are undetermined to achieve this objective. Further studies aim at having results on the quotient set Θ/ ∼.</p><p>Our third perspective is to propose new intuitive syntax(es) of containment relations. The main problem was the semantic overload of the negation symbol (¬) in the literature of negative sequential patterns. We are currently working on some proposals and plan to evaluate them. To be intuitive, these proposals are based on the equivalent classes we highlight in this work.</p><p>Proof of Lemma 2. Let e = (e i ) i∈[m] ∈ [n] m be aembedding of a NSP p = p 1 ¬q 1 . . . ¬q m-1 p m in a sequence s = s 1 . . . s n . For all positive itemsets p i , the definition of -embedding matches the one forembedding. For a negative itemset q i , let us start with := .

Lemma 2 shows that -embedding impliesembedding. It remains the implication to the left. Let e = (e i ) i∈[m] ∈ [n] m be a -embedding of pattern p in sequence s. Then, the definition matches the one forembedding for positives, p i . For negatives, q i , then ∀ j ∈ [e i + 1, e i+1 -1], q i s j , i.e. ∀ j ∈ [e i + 1, e i+1 -1], ∀α ∈ q i , α s j and then ∀α ∈ q i , ∀ j ∈ [e i + 1, e i+1 -1], α s j .

Let e = (e i ) i∈[m] ∈ [n] m be a -embedding of p in s then, by definition, 1) p i ⊆ s e i for all i ∈ [m] and 2) q i s j for all j ∈ [e i + 1, e i+1 -1]. In case |q i | = 0, there is no constraint. In case |q i | = 1, and 2) becomes q i s j for all j ∈ [e i + 1, e i+1 -1] whatever ∈ { , }. Hence, q i j∈[e i +1,e i+1 -1] s j i.e. q i j∈[e i +1,e i+1 -1] s j (no matter or ). As a consequence e is a -embedding of p.</p><p>Proof of Lemma 5. Let s = s 1 . . . s n be a sequence and p = p 1 ¬q 1 . . . ¬q m-1 p m ∈ N be a pattern. By definition 4, if e = (e i ) i∈[m] ∈ [n] m is an embedding of pattern p in sequence s then ∀i ∈ [l]: p i ⊆ s e i because p i is positive.

Then, there exists e an embedding of p + in s and, by definition, it is also an embedding of p in s. This means that p s.</p><p>Proof of Lemma 7. Let s = s 1 . . . s n be a sequence and p = p 1 ¬q 1 . . . ¬q m-1 p m ∈ N be a pattern. We start by considering relations between semantics at the embedding level, and then we will conclude at the pattern level.</p><p>Let's first assume that := .

It comes that e is a ( , )-embedding.</p><p>Let's now assume that := . Then, let e = (e i ) i∈[m] be a ( , )-embedding of pattern p in sequence s. Hence, ∀i ∈ [m], p i ⊆ s e i and ∀i ∈ [m -1], q i j∈[e i +1,e i+1 -1] s j . In addition j∈[e i +1,e i+1 -1] s j ⊆ I, then, ∀i ∈ [m -1], q i j∈[e i +1,e i+1 -1] s j according to eq. 1. It comes that e is an ( , )-embedding.</p><p>Let's come back at the pattern level. if p s, in the two cases ( ∈ { , }). In the first case the existing ( , )embedding is a ( , )-embedding, and in the second case, all ( , )-embeddings are ( , )-embeddings. Therefore, we have that p s.</p><p>Proof of Lemma According to Lemma 2, a -embedding is a -embedding whatever the itemset non-inclusion operator. Then, we can conclude that p s =⇒ p s (Equality 4). In addition, Lemma 3 shows that a -embedding isembedding in case of total itemset non-inclusion. Then, we can conclude that p s =⇒ p s (Equality 5).</p><p>Let now gives some counterexamples for known nondominance relationships. A counterexample for Equation Proof of Lemma 10.

Hence, p p .</p><p>We now prove the second implication: p p =⇒ p • p . Let p, p ∈ N s.t. p p . Let's now define the sequence u i such that u i = i for all i ∈ [k].

If p k p k the third condition of • is satisfied (with j = k).</formula><p>Otherwise, it is also satisfied with the j of the definition of .</p><p>Proof of Proposition 2. We begin with the + relation. We first remind that + is a strict partial order iff the three following conditions hold: Then, for all i ∈ [k], p i = p i = p i and for all i ∈ [k -1], q i ⊆ q i ⊆ q i (k = k = k ). Finally, it is not possible to have q i = q i for all i ∈ [k -1]. In fact, if we have these equalities, then we would have q i = q i and q i = q i for all i ∈ [k -1] because q i ⊆ q i ⊆ q i . But, it is not possible according to 3. Therefore, we have that p + p . Asymmetry. Let p, p ∈ N s.t. p + p . Then, according to 2. and 3., there exists j ∈ [k -1] s.t. q j q j . And then, it is not possible to have q j ⊆ q j . As a consequence, we can not have p + p. We now prove that is a strict partial order. Irreflexive. Let's assume that ∃ ∈ N s.t. p p.

If q j q j , then, according to 2. q j j∈[u i ,u i+1 -1] q j = q j . Thus, it is not possible to have q j ⊆ q j = j∈[u i ,u i+1 -1] q j . As a consequence, we can not have p • p.</p><p>Proof of Proposition 3. We start this proof by a small result about the anti-monotonicity of . Let P, Q ∈ I be two itemsets s.t. P ⊆ Q, and I ∈ I another itemset. Then, Q I =⇒ P I. In fact, Q I implies that for all e ∈ Q, e I, and because P ⊆ Q, we also have that e ∈ P, e I.</p><p>Let p = p 1 ¬q 1 . . . ¬q m-1 p m ∈ N and p = p 1 ¬q 1 . . . ¬q m -1 p m ∈ N be two NSP s.t. p p .

By Definition 4, we have p i ⊆ s e i , ∀i ∈ [m ] and q i s j , for all j ∈ [e i + 1, e i+1 -1] and for all i ∈ [m -1]. On the other side, p p implies that p i ⊆ p i for all i ∈ [m]. Then, because m ≤ m ( p p ), we have that p i ⊆ s e i for all i ∈ [m]. In addition, p p also implies that q i ⊆ q i for all i ∈ [m -1] and thus, by anti-monotonicity of (and q i s j ), we have q i s j for all j ∈ [e i + 1, e i+1 -1] and for all i ∈ [m -1].

According to 1. and because k = k , p + = p+, and then (e i ) i∈[k] is an embedding of p in s. Thus, we shown that there is at least one embedding of p + in s.
