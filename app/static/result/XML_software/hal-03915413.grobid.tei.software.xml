<div><head>Introduction</head><p>The uptake of soil water by roots is crucial for the growth and survival of most of terrestrial plants. Root water uptake allows the plant to maintain its water status, under favorable or adverse environmental conditions such as drought, by continuously balancing transpirational water losses and supplying water required for expansion growth <ref type="bibr">(Steudle, 2000a)</ref>. Root water uptake sequentially involves a radial transport of water from the soil to the root stele and its axial transport along the root vasculature. Radial transport is mediated through cell wall (apoplastic) and cell-to-cell (symplastic or transcellular) pathways running across peripheral cell layers (epidermis, cortex, endodermis) down to the xylem. Transcellular water transport is mediated in large part by aquaporin (AQP) water channels <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Maurel et al., 2015)</ref>. Axial transport consists of conveying sap flow along xylem vessels, throughout the whole root system architecture (RAS), up to the aerial parts <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gambetta et al., 2017)</ref>. The conductance of the radial and axial pathways can be altered in response to multiple environmental cues, providing a continuous adjustment of root hydraulics to water availability and demand <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aroca et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr">Boursiac et al., 2022b)</ref>. In particular, water deprivation can lead to rapid changes in AQP activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hachez et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">)</ref>. These effects which depend on drought intensity can result, depending on genetic background, in a monotonous inhibition of root hydraulic conductivity (Lp r ) or in bell-shaped dose-response curves <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Rosales et al., 2019)</ref>. On the longer term, WD can also alter xylem development with contrasting effects depending on species <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Ramachandran et al., 2020)</ref>. Finally, WD enhances suberization of both exo-and endodermis, possibly altering solute transport <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Doblas et al., 2017)</ref>.</p><p>In recent years, efforts have been made to assess the radial and axial water transport properties of plant roots, using a combination of experimental and mathematical modeling approaches on excised segments or whole root systems <ref type="bibr">(Boursiac et al., 2022a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Heymans et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Meunier et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zarebanadkouki et al., 2016)</ref>. Most recent works rely on hydraulic models imbedded within RSA, based on the Hydraulic Tree Model of Doussan et al. <ref type="bibr">(Boursiac et al., 2022a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Doussan et al., 1998a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Doussan et al., 1998b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Meunier et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zarebanadkouki et al., 2016)</ref>, or on approaches that combine a hydraulic cross-sectional model at cellular level with anatomical observations along the root <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Couvreur et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Ding et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Heymans et al., 2021)</ref>.</p><p>More integrative root models that couple water and solute transport have also been existing for decades. The first models were based on a representation of the root as an osmometer. The whole root system was reduced to one, two or even three membranes separating homogeneous compartments <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fiscus, 1975</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fiscus, , 1977</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fiscus, , 1986;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Miller, 1985b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Murphy, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr">Steudle, 1994)</ref>. Some more recent models provide a longitudinal, bi-dimensional representation of unbranched root structures considering the role and transport selectivity of Casparian strips and suberin lamellae <ref type="bibr">(Foster and</ref><ref type="bibr">Miklavcic, 2016, 2017)</ref>. Complementary to these, <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Couvreur et al., 2018)</ref> proposed a 2D crosssectional model computing water transport at subcellular levels (walls, membranes, and plasmodesmata) and considering apoplastic solute diffusion and symplastic homeostasis.</p><p>Hydraulic models at RSA level are designed to account for the non-uniformity of hydraulic parameters like axial conductance. Therefore, they can efficiently simulate the heterogeneity, over the whole root system, of radial and axial hydraulic flows and of water potential components (e.g. hydrostatic pressure in the xylem). However, none of these models has been able to simulate whole A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t root water transport under WD conditions, when osmotic driving forces become predominant. Current root osmometer models can do so but, conversely, cannot represent the heterogeneous aspects of a RSA since the root is modeled as a restricted number of compartments in which solute concentration is homogeneous and pressure is uniform. Interestingly, these models have been able to mimic to a certain extent some experimental and puzzling observations like the non-linear relation between sap flow and pressure <ref type="bibr">(Steudle, 1994)</ref>. Integrating water and solute transport models within RSA could therefore provide a means to account for all the pre-cited aspects and, ultimately, investigate the multiple effects of WD on root water and solute transport parameters. <ref type="bibr">Boursiac et al. recently</ref> proposed an inverse modeling approach, based on pressure chamber measurements in excised roots, to simultaneously assess axial conductance and radial conductivity of complex branched root structures <ref type="bibr">(Boursiac et al., 2022a)</ref>. This approach, called cut-and-flow, consists in measuring exuding sap flow rate, at a constant working pressure, in a root system that is successively cut from its distal part. A Hydraulic Tree Model named HydroRoot (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.6584200) was inverted to fit the cut-and-flow data, thereby allowing a determination of the axial conductance profile and radial conductivity on the same root system. Because it exclusively considers hydrostatic driving forces, this model cannot operate in roots under WD or when osmotic forces are predominant.</p><p>To fill this gap and describe the concomitant transport of water and solutes in roots under WD, we coupled within realistic RSAs of maize seedlings a hydraulic model to a solute transport model of Fiscus' type <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fiscus, 1977)</ref>. Cut-and-flow data and pressure-to flow relationships (J v (P)) were used in an inverse modeling approach to determine the radial and axial hydraulic conductivities of primary roots grown under standard or WD conditions. This approach allows to resolve dramatic effects of WD on both radial and axial conductivities.</p></div>

<div><head>Plant material, growth and experimental conditions</head><p>Seeds of a maize B73-UH007 hybrid (B73H) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Millet et al., 2016)</ref> were surface-sterilized in 50 ml of 1.4% bleach with a drop (~ 50 µL) of Tween-20 for 15 min under gentle agitation. The seeds were then treated with 35% H 2 O 2 for 2 min, rinsed with 70% ethanol, and washed 6 times with sterilized water. The seeds were overlaid with wet clay beads in a plastic box, which was itself covered by a transparent plastic film. Seeds were germinated in the dark and further grown in a growth chamber at 65% relative humidity, with 22°C/20°C and 15 h/9 h light/dark cycles (150 µE.m -2 .s -1 ).</p><p>At five days after sawing (DAS), seedlings were transferred to a hydroponic container filled with 24 L of a medium containing 1.25mM KNO 3 , 0.75mM MgSO 4 , 1.5mM Ca(NO 3 ) 2 , 0.5mM KH 2 PO 4 , 0.1mM MgCl 2 , 0.05mM Fe-EDTA, 0.05mM H 3 BO 3 , 0.012mM MnSO 4 , 0.7mM CuSO 4 , 0.001mM ZnSO 4 , 24.10 -5 mM MoO 4 Na 2 , 1.10 -5 mM CoCl 2 , 0.1mM Na 2 SiO 3 , and 1mM MES. Plants were grown in this solution for two days. At seven DAS, seedlings were transferred for four additional days to a fresh medium containing 150 g/L of high molecular weight polyethylene glycol (PEG-8000) to reduce the water potential of the nutrient solution. The control plants were transferred for four days in a fresh hydroponic solution. The water potential of the control hydroponic solution (-0.034 MPa) was measured with a WESCOR 5520 vapor pressure, with a resolution of 1 mmol/kg (2.5 10 -3 MPa at 293 °K). Addition of 150 g/L PEG to the control solution leads to a final water potential of -MPa,  Overall, two bathing solutions were used for plant growth and pressure chamber experiments: the control (CTR) hydroponic solution and the hydroponic solution containing 150 g/L PEG (PEG). This resulted in three plant sets:</p><p>(i) eight CTR plants, grown in a CTR hydroponic solution, with measurements done in the same solution (ii) eight PEG plants grown in a PEG hydroponic solution, with measurements done in the same solution (iii) five PEG-CTR plants grown in a PEG hydroponic solution, and transferred into a CTR solution for one hour prior to water transport measurements in the same CTR solution.</p></div>
<div><head>Measurements of pressure-dependent xylem sap flow [Jv(P)]</head><p>Root water flow was measured on de-topped primary roots using a set of pressure chambers with automated recording as described in <ref type="bibr">(Boursiac et al., 2022a)</ref>. The primary root was carefully excised below the grain, placed into an adapter sealed with dental paste (Coltene Whaledent, France) and threaded across the silicone seal of the pressure chamber lid. The root was then placed into the pressure chamber in a container filled with either a CTR or PEG hydroponic solution. The adapter was connected to a flowmeter (Bronkhorst, France) in order to record the flow of sap (J v ) from the root system at successive pressures (P) applied on the bathing solution using nitrogen gas. Typical successive relative pressure steps were, in MPa: 0.00, 0.05, 0.15, 0.10, 0.25, 0.20, 0.35, 0.30, 0.45, 0.50, 0.25, 0.00. (0.00 represents the atmospheric pressure). Some experimental data sets comprise fewer pressure steps, down to 4 including exudation at atmospheric pressure. Only 4 plants over 21 had less than 6 steps.</p><p>To estimate the deviation of a measured or adjusted J v (P) relationship from a linear response to pressure, we normalized between 0 and 1 the fluxes and pressures according to their minima and maxima. This allows to compare roots that have very disparate fluxes in absolute values. We then quantified the gap to linearity by the maximal residual between the J v (P) relationship and the bisector.</p></div>
<div><head>Cut-and-flow experiment</head><p>Cut-and-flow measurements were performed just after J v (P) measurements. The operating pressure was set constant over the whole experiment: 0.3 MPa with PEG solution and 0.2 MPa with CTR solution (unless for two plants done at 0.3 MPa as well). In brief, and along the lines of our previous work <ref type="bibr">(Boursiac et al., 2022a)</ref>, J v was first recorded in the intact root system at the operating pressure. The root was taken out of the chamber and placed in a petri dish filled with their bathing solution. The lateral roots were stretched and aligned along the primary root and the whole root system was cut with a razor blade at a given distance to the tip, typically a few centimeters. Leaving the cut root segments in the petri dish, the remaining part of the root system was placed back into the chamber at the operating pressure and the J v was recorded. This procedure was repeated successively.</p><p>To be as fast as possible during the cutting process (average cutting time was 140 ± 8 s), the cut length between successive excisions was approximate. Overall, the first cuts were 8.3 ± 0.6 cm on A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t average whereas the mean length of subsequent cuts was 4.3 ± 0.2 cm and the average length of the remaining root system was 5.2 ± 0.6 cm.</p></div>
<div><head>Digitizing of root architectures</head><p>The root segments released after each cut and the basal root system remaining after the last cut were scanned at 600 dpi. The root parts were then digitized using <software ContextAttributes="used">SmartRoot</software> <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Lobet et al., 2011)</ref>, an <software ContextAttributes="used">ImageJ</software> plugin, the segment lengths and the lateral position on their parent root were exported as text file in csv format. The complete root system was then reconstructed by recognizing, at each cut, the segments belonging to the primary root and the ones belonging to the laterals, and by pasting them to the remaining system. For example, considering an experiment with n successive cuts, the segments from the last cut were pasted to the remaining basal root system. Then the segments from the previous cut (n-1) were pasted to this new basal root system, and so on. Note that we did not scan the intact root system to avoid any damage before measurements.</p><p>The diameters of the primary root and its laterals were entered into the model for building the representation of the RSA (see Water and solute transport model). They were determined from three independent panels of CTR and PEG plants. Each experiment had six to ten plants of each type, yielding a final count of 23 CTR and 28 PEG plants. The roots were scanned, and the diameters were estimated using <software>ImageJ</software>. The average primary root diameters were 1.05 mm (n=104) and 1.03 mm (n=133) for CTR and PEG plants, respectively, with standard errors in the range of 2 10 -3 mm. The average lateral root diameters were 0.36 mm (n=1345) and 0.39 mm (n=1495) for CTR and PEG plants, respectively, with standard errors below 2 10 -4 mm. The 11-day-old roots had only first order laterals.</p></div>
<div><head>Water and solute transport model</head><p>The present model is a modification of the HydroRoot RSA hydraulic model <ref type="bibr">(Boursiac et al., 2022a)</ref>. HydroRoot was developed as a component of the <software ContextAttributes="created">OpenAlea</software> platform <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Pradal et al., 2008)</ref>. It uses a Multiscale Tree Graph (MTG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Godin and Caraglio, 1998)</ref> to represent a root hydraulic architecture, which consists of the topology of a root system (branching positions, root lengths, root radii, etc.) and its hydraulic structure (local radial and axial conductivities). With respect to <ref type="bibr">(Boursiac et al., 2022a)</ref>, the main modification of HydroRoot was the addition of solute transport equations to the hydraulic model. This change led to a major difference in the resolution of the equation system on the whole RSA. Thus, the hydraulic architecture can no longer be modeled by an analogous electrical network <ref type="bibr">(Boursiac et al., 2022a)</ref> and the coupled solute and water transport equations had to be solved in a matrix form.</p><p>The model was developed at millimetric scale, the order of magnitude of the primary root diameter. The RSA was discretized in cylindrical elementary volumes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1</ref>), considered as representative elementary volumes (REV). The REV diameter, d, is equal to the root diameter, and depends on the root order (primary or first laterals). The REV length, , is of the order of the diameter, here 1 mm, which was small enough to get numerical convergence. The local transport equations described below were considered in each REV. Each REV can be seen as two concentric media: the peripheral tissues (from epidermis to pericycle) through which radial transport happens, and a central medium (stele with xylem vessels) where the sap flows axially. In the following, the parameter units are displayed within brackets and correspond to the international system of units. </p></div>
<div><head>Water transport</head><p>The hydraulic model is the same as in HydroRoot, with the addition of a radial water flow rate due to osmotic potential difference. Thus, the radial water flux can be modeled as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">( )<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where j is the local radial water flow rate, k (m.s -1 .MPa -1 ) the radial hydraulic conductivity. , and</p><p>(MPa) correspond to the hydrostatic water potential difference between the bathing solution and the xylem sap, to the osmotic water potential difference due to the PEG and to the osmotic water potential difference due to the solutes, respectively. σ is the effective reflection coefficient. S (</p><p>) is the external surface area of the REV (m²). Expressing the water potentials, equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_0">1</ref>) can be written as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">( ( ))<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where P e and P are the hydrostatic pressure of the bathing solution and within the xylem vessels, respectively, and the PEG contribution to the osmotic pressure of the bathing solution and inside the xylem vessels, respectively, C e and C the solute concentration in the bathing solution and in the xylem vessels (mol.m -3 ),respectively, R the gas constant, T the temperature (set to 298°K here). Both and are calculated according to PEG concentration (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S1A</ref>). Since PEG 8000 is a non-permeant solute, its contribution to the osmotic pressure inside the xylem (</p><p>) is only considered in cut-and-flow experiments within PEG bathing solutions.</p><p>The axial sap flow rate was modeled with a Hagen-Poiseuille's law type:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">( )<label>(3)</label></formula><p>where J is the axial sap flow rate, K(μ) the axial conductance that depends on sap viscosity (m 4 .s - 1 .MPa -1 ; see below), ΔP the local pressure difference between two REVs, the length of the REV. The axial conductance is inversely proportional to the fluid viscosity μ, as illustrated for example by the conductance in a cylindrical capillary of radius r: ( ) ( ). The sap is commonly considered having water viscosity. Thus, axial conductances were displayed as corresponding to a sap viscosity of 1 mPa.s (equation (3)) and not independently of the viscosity, as follows:</p><p>( ) ( ) .The former expression is commonly used in the literature <ref type="bibr">(Doussan et al., 1998a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Doussan et al., 1998b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Heymans et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Landsberg and Fowkes, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Meunier et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zarebanadkouki et al., 2016)</ref> and allows better comparisons. Note, however, that when PEG penetrates the root vasculature in cut-and-flow experiments, the viscosity significantly increases with the PEG concentration (see next paragraph) and has to be taken into account.</p><p>To reduce the number of parameters to be adjusted (see Parameter determination), σ was set to 0.85, a value reported for nutrients on maize root systems <ref type="bibr">(Miller, 1985a)</ref>. Sensitivity tests were done to evaluate the impact of σ on the other parameters (see Results and Discussion). </p></div>
<div><head>Solute transport</head><p>The modeling of solute transport is based on two experimental observations: exudation at atmospheric pressure and negative sap flow observed in some PEG roots. Under atmospheric pressure monitoring, sap flow is driven by the osmotic pressure gradient due to the solute concentration difference between the outer solution and xylem sap (see equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>)). Pure hydraulic models, without any solute transport to the xylem vessels, cannot explain such behavior in steady state. To account for a constant positive exudation rate, the solutes exiting the root by exudation must indeed be balanced by an uptake of solutes. Thus, in addition to the water radial flux, we hypothesized a constant active uptake rate of solutes, noted J s * after Fiscus <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fiscus, 1975</ref>).</p><p>Yet, the steady and negative sap flow rate observed in some PEG roots raises specific questions. If sap continuously flows from the root base to the bathing solution, whereas solutes driven by J s * keep entering the root at a constant rate, the solute concentration in xylem vessels should increase indefinitely, in contradiction with the mass balance principle that should be verified in any REV of the root. Therefore, an additional solute flux, or leakage, from the xylem vessels to root bathing solution, was modeled as a passive diffusion characterized by the tissue permeability P s . The radial solute flux was therefore expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">[ ( )]<label>(4)</label></formula><p>where j s (mol.s -1 ) is the radial solute flux, J s * (mol.m -2 .s -1 ) is the solute active uptake rate and P s (m.s -1 )</p><p>is the radial permeability of the root peripheral tissues. As in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>), C and C e correspond to the solute concentration in the xylem vessels and in the bathing solution, respectively. S is the external surface area of the REV.</p><p>Since solutes are transported along xylem vessels by advection, axial solute flux can be expressed as (mol.s -1 ). When PEG penetrates the root in cut-and-flow experiments, its axial flux has the same form: (mol.s -1 ) where C peg is the PEG concentration in the xylem vessels. Details about the discretization of the equations and their resolution on the matrix form of the RSA can be found in Supplementary Protocol S1.</p><p>The overall coupled model of solute and water transport within a RSA is summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">1</ref>. The subfigure C sketches a case where the hydrostatic pressure of the bathing solution is greater than the atmospheric pressure at the basal part of the root, and the outer concentration of solutes is lower than the sap one. Added to the radial water flux, the two solute transport components (J s * , P s ) are also represented.</p></div>
<div><head>Viscosity and water potential of a PEG solution</head><p>The water potential of a PEG solution, , does not follow the Van't Hoff's law but can be described, at a given temperature, by an empirical polynomial law (see equation 1 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Michel, 1983)</ref> and Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S1 A</ref>). The osmotic pressure of PEG solution can be expressed as .

<div><head>Parameter determination</head><p>The principle is to adjust the axial conductance (K) profile, the radial hydraulic conductivity (k), the active solute uptake (J s * ) and the solute permeability (P s ) to get the best fit on both J v (P) and cut-andflow experiments.

The K profile was therefore represented as a linear piecewise function of the distance to root tip.

<div><head>Jv(P) and cut-and-flow experiments in roots under control and WD conditions</head><p>Focusing on functional responses of maize primary roots to WD, the pressure chamber technique was used to measure the flow-to-pressure relationship [J v (P)] and obtain cut-and-flow data in detopped roots. WD was induced by addition of PEG-8000 (150 g/L), lowering the water potential of the bathing solution to -0.336 MPa. Three different sets of growth and experimental conditions were used. Control (CTR) plants were grown in a standard hydroponic solution and de-topped roots were studied in the same solution. PEG plants were exposed to WD for 5 d with water transport measurements done in the same PEG bathing solution. PEG-CTR roots were derived from plants grown in a PEG solution and transferred into a control solution for one hour prior to pressure chamber measurements in a control solution. Besides methodological considerations, the latter treatment allows to explore the reversibility of WD effects on root water transport parameters.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2</ref> shows six examples of J v (P) relationships measured in the three series of roots. PEG roots (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2</ref> C and D) showed non-linear curves, a properties observed in six out of eight plants. In contrast, J v (P) curves of the two other root types (CTR or PEG-CTR) were more linear. Yet, two of these roots (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2</ref> A and F) showed a weak non-linearity below 0.1 MPa. Another key property emphasized by Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2</ref> D is the possible occurrence of negative xylem flow rates for positive hydrostatic pressure differences, up to 0.2 MPa. This is also shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">3</ref>, which displays xylem flow rates at atmospheric pressure [J 0 =J v (0)], i.e. without any external hydrostatic driving force. These flow rates are very stable over time and could be measured in some roots for up to one hour. For the eight PEG roots, the average J 0 was -2.5 ± 0.9 10 -3 L.s -1 . By contrast, roots bathing in a control hydroponic solution yielded positive J 0 values (CTR: J 0 = 2.1 ± 0.8 10 -2 L.s -1 ; PEG-CTR: J 0 = 1.4 ± 0.6 10 -2 L.s -1 ) (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">3</ref>).</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4</ref> is the counterpart of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2</ref>. It refers to the same individual roots, showing corresponding cut-and-flow experiments performed after J v (P) measurements (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2</ref>). In brief, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4</ref> shows increases in pressure-induced flow rate upon progressive cuts of the root system from root tips to base. The curves determined in CTR roots are characterized by a low initial slope that increases with length of the cut root (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4 A</ref> and<ref type="figure">B</ref>). The four other curves, derived from PEG and PEG-CTR roots, show a less convex shape, with higher slopes from the first cut. Thus, the cutand-flow curves catch the impact on root functional properties of plant growth under WD.</p><p>The same conclusions can be drawn from J v (P) and cut-and-flow data obtained in a total of 15 additional CTR, PEG or PEG-CTR roots (Supplemental Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">2, 3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4</ref>).</p></div>
<div><head>Integration of solute and water flows throughout RSA</head><p>Based on the experimental data documented above, we developed a RSA model of water and solute transport allowing to fit the J v (P) and cut-and-flow data of roots exposed to control or WD conditions (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4</ref>; Supplemental Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">2, 3</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4</ref>). Indeed, a pure water transport model could not explain exudation at atmospheric pressure or negative fluxes observed in some PEG roots. Basically, an osmotic term was added to the radial water flux (equation 1 and 2) and solute transport was coupled to hydraulic flow. Using the model within realistic RSA allowed to map the heterogeneity of solute and water flows throughout the root. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5</ref> shows representative CTR (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5A-C</ref> A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t overpressure of 0.1 MPa. Note that, as indicated below, the hydraulic and solute transport parameters were determined by fitting J v (P) and cut and flow data (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2A</ref> and 2C; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4A</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4C</ref>). For each root, the figure depicts the heat map of the hydrostatic and osmotic driving components (see equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>)), and , and the resulting local radial water fluxes. The CTR root shows an increasing ΔP from the tips to the base with a negative difference at the primary tip that would drive a radial efflux of water (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5 A</ref>). Yet, influxes occur throughout the RSA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5C</ref>), indicating that the dominating force driving water influx in the primary tip is (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5 B</ref>). In addition, a progressive drop in xylem solute concentration is observed along the RSA, due to dilution effects by the sap flow. Thus, the progressive increase in radial flows along the RSA can be explained by a dominating effects of variations in ΔP over variations in ΔC (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5 C</ref>). Although the PEG root is bathing in a medium with a low osmotic potential (-0.336 MPa), it presents the same trends as the CTR root, with water influxes throughout the RSA, a progressive increase of ΔP from the tips to the base and, inversely, a progressive drop of ΔC (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5 D-F</ref>). Whereas radial water influx varies in parallel to variation, as in the CTR root, the absolute value of ΔP remains in the range of 0.1 MPa which is insufficient to counter balance the external water potential of -0.336 MPa. Therefore, both and serve as joint driving forces. Finally, we note that, although the PEG root harbors gradient properties throughout its architecture, these variations are of very low amplitude (&lt; 1%), much lower than in the CTR root ( (MPa); (Mol.m -3 )). Therefore, the PEG root has much more homogeneous properties inside the xylem vessels than the CTR root.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">6</ref> shows the heat maps of ΔP, ΔC and local radial fluxes in a representative CTR root, but under spontaneous exudation condition. A water influx can be observed throughout the RSA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">6C</ref>). Yet, a negative ΔP can be observed over the whole architecture, with an increasing value to the base (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">6A</ref>). Such ΔP, which counteracts radial water inflow, is due to the induction of a sap flow in the xylem. As discussed above, the ΔC decrease to the tips results from dilution effects due to water flow (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">6B</ref>). Therefore, the major driving force for radial influx is ΔC, and its variation along the RSA is concomitantly controlled by ΔP and ΔC.</p><p>These few examples illustrate the capacity of the present modeling approach to resolve how integration throughout a RSA of discretized elementary modules leads to heterogeneity in driving forces and elementary flows, depending both on root type and water transport mode.</p></div>
<div><head>Axial conductance profiles of roots under standard and WD conditions.</head><p>The present approach was further used to obtain a comprehensive view, using model inversion, of the water and solute transport properties of real roots, obtained from CTR or PEG plants, and measured in CTR or PEG solutions. Here again, parameter adjustments were done concomitantly on the J v (P) and cut-and-flow data, taking into account penetration of PEG in xylem vessels during cutand-flow experiments. One set of parameters was therefore obtained for each of 21 roots investigated. Best fits of these experiments are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">4</ref> and Supplemental Figures 2, 3 and 4. We note that, for all roots investigated, the goodness of fit (R²) for the relationship between the measures and values simulated from the fitted model was higher than 0.91 (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">S5</ref>). Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">7</ref> shows the axial conductance (K) profiles obtained by Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing (lowess) of CTR (n=8), PEG (n=8) and PEG-CTR (n=5) data sets. The K profiles of roots grown in the presence of PEG, whatever the J v (P) measuring solution (PEG or CTR), are very close to each other. Since measurements in PEG-CTR roots were performed one hour after their transfer into a CTR solution, we assume that their xylem anatomy (and therefore their K profile) was similar to that of PEG roots. Thus, these results indicate that the bathing solution used during the cut-and-flow experiment, and in particular the presence or absence of PEG, does not interfere with the determination of K. As a consequence, our approach reveals, with respect to CTR roots, a dramatic increase of K in root tips grown under WD.</p></div>
<div><head>Determination of radial hydraulic conductivity and solute transport parameters</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">8</ref> shows the distribution of the three radial transport parameters giving the best fits. With respect to CTR roots, PEG roots showed a tenfold decrease in mean radial hydraulic conductivity (k). This result is in accordance with the decrease in hydraulic conductivity commonly observed in roots under WD <ref type="bibr">(Steudle, 2000b)</ref>, such as in Arabidopsis grown in a 150 g/L PEG solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Rosales et al., 2019)</ref>. PEG-CTR roots showed k values similar to those of CTR roots pointing to a quick reversal of the WD-induced inhibition of k. The solute transport parameters (J s * , P s ) were more difficult to interpret with respect to known effects of WD. This difficulty was reflected by the fact that the CTR and PEG-CTR data were very scattered.</p></div>
<div><head>Sensitivity analysis of the model</head><p>To possibly understand the scattering of J s * and P s inferred values, we investigated the sensitivity of adjusted k to the two solute transport parameters. In the following, we note k 0 , J s0 * and P s0 the parameter values giving the best fit. The test was run for the CTR and PEG roots corresponding to panels A and C of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">2</ref>, respectively. It consisted in adjusting k on J v (P) for various values of J s * and P s and to look at the range of J s * and P s variations for a 10% change of k around k 0 . For the CTR root, a ±10 % variation of the adjusted k was obtained for J s varying from 5 10 -4 to 4 times J s0 and for P s varying from 5 10 -4 to 131 times P s0 . The objective function (F) was almost multiplied by 10, varying from its minimum 2.6 10 -4 to 2.2 10 -3 . In the PEG root, a ±10 % change of the adjusted k was obtained for J s varying from 4 10 -4 to 2.05 times J s0 and for P s varying from 1 10 -3 to 4.0 times P s0 with F varying by two orders of magnitude from its minimums. Thus, in either type of roots, the determination of radial hydraulic conductivity k shows low sensitivity to the active uptake rate and the passive permeability of solutes.</p><p>In the present model, the reflection coefficient (σ) was initially set to 0.85, a value previously reported for nutrients in maize root systems <ref type="bibr">(Miller, 1985a)</ref>. In order to evaluate the impact of σ on determination of other parameters, we performed two sets of adjustment, with two contrasting values, σ = 1 and σ = 0.5, respectively. With respect to axial conductance profiles determined with σ = 0.85, the maximum discrepancy was obtained for CTR roots and σ = 1, with an average change of K of 1.2%. In all the other cases, K variations were lower than 1%. Determination of k was also largely insensitive to σ with a maximum change of mean k below 3% (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">S6 A</ref> and<ref type="figure">D</ref>). For the two other parameters, P s and J s</p></div>
<div><head>A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t</head><p>These analyses assess the accuracy with which effects of WD on root hydraulic parameters can be determined using the present inverse modeling approach.</p></div>
<div><head>Discussion</head><p>In the present work, we developed a model of root hydraulic architecture aimed at describing the behavior of maize primary roots under control or WD conditions. Besides radial and axial water transport, that were represented using a fairly classical Hydraulic Tree Model, solute transport was also considered throughout RSA, using both an active uptake rate and a tissue permeability coefficient. As in our earlier work <ref type="bibr">(Boursiac et al., 2022a)</ref>, our main aim was to develop an inverse modeling approach to assess the radial conductivity and the axial conductance profile of a branched root system. Yet, this procedure was improved as it relied not only on sap flow data obtained in cutand-flow experiments but also on extensive J v (P) data obtained in intact roots. Most importantly, this procedure was validated in plants grown under standard conditions or PEG-induced WD. We showed that the solute transport must be considered to explain sap exudation at atmospheric pressure, when the driving force is essentially osmotic. Solute transport also allows to fit the specific features of the J v (P) data of some plants under WD with a non-linear relationship and negative sap fluxes. The experiments performed in different conditions demonstrated the robustness of the method to determine concomitantly the radial and axial water transport parameters on real RSA. Most importantly, they allowed us to obtain a comprehensive view of combined effects of WD on radial and axial hydraulic conductances.</p></div>
<div><head>The Jv(P) curve shape</head><p>The J v (P) data reported in the present work showed two key properties: negative sap flow rates specific to PEG roots, and a non-linearity that was particularly accentuated in PEG roots. A nonlinearity of sap flow according to applied pressure has already been described in maize <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Gorska et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Miller, 1985b)</ref> or other plant species <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fiscus, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Jackson et al., 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Markhart and Smit, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rüdinger et al., 1994)</ref>. For instance, Miller <ref type="bibr">(Miller, 1985b)</ref> reported J v (P) curves that were linear for positive relative pressures but showed a non-linear shape at negative relative pressures. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Gorska et al. (Gorska et al., 2008)</ref> observed that the J v (P) relationship can be considered as linear only for pressure above 0.1 MPa. These reports are in accordance with our measurements in roots bathing in a CTR solution, whatever the plant growth conditions (CTR or PEG). For roots grown and maintained under WD, we found the non-linearity to be further accentuated. This can be explained by the dramatically reduced radial conductivity of these roots (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">8 A</ref>). Since the non-linearity of J v (P) results from the changing balance between hydrostatic and osmotic driving forces, the reduced radial conductivity shifts to higher positive pressures the range at which the hydrostatic forces become preponderant and J v (P) linear.</p><p>Yet, the non-linearity of J v (P) cannot be modeled without considering solute transport. An absence of solute fluxes would imply that the osmotic pressure term in equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) is uniform over the RSA, leading to a linear relation. In fact, when J v (P) is monitored at high flow rates, this function can reasonably be adjusted with a linear fit. The slope can then be interpreted as the root hydraulic conductance, which yields the root hydraulic conductivity. In addition, the intercept with the pressure axis, P 0 , is usually assumed to be the pressure needed to counter balance the osmotic pressure of the bathing solution <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Passioura, 1988)</ref>. To explore this further, we tried to determine K Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/jxb/advance-article/doi/10.1093/jxb/erac471/6896019 by guest on 02 January 2023 A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t and k using such a purely hydraulic model, i.e. exclusively based on equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) and (3). In equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>), the osmotic pressure term was set constant and equal to P 0 and therefore equation ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) was expressed as ( ) , with P being the relative pressure. The fits were done on the linear part of J v (P) and on the cut-and-flow experiment. In CTR roots, k was found to be reduced by 9 % with respect to the value obtained with the water-solute transport model. The errors on K axial conductance profile were higher, up to 37 %. In PEG roots, the differences between the two model settings were higher, the averaged k being reduced by 21 % and K by up to 84 % when the osmotic pressure term was set to P 0 . Thus, a simplified osmotic model which does not take solute transport into account results in significant variations in hydraulic parameter estimations. Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">S7</ref> shows best fits of the experiments with a purely hydraulic model, and a constant osmotic pressure P 0 . While the quality of fit with CTR roots is good (R² = 0.95), this type of model is unable to fit the PEG data at low pressure when the osmotic term is preponderant (R² &lt; 0.83).</p></div>
<div><head>Development of a water/solute model at RSA level</head><p>Models that couple water and solute transport have been existing for decades, but they usually represent the whole root as a simplified osmometer with two or three compartments <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fiscus, 1975</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fiscus, , 1977</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fiscus, , 1986;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Miller, 1985b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Steudle, 1994</ref><ref type="bibr">Steudle, , 2000a))</ref>. In these models, the root interior (i.e. the inner volume of the xylem vessels) is supposed to have a homogeneous solute concentration and hydrostatic pressure. Consequently, the water and solutes fluxes are uniform all over the root surface. This is, however, not the case in real root systems, where sap flow through axial resistances results in a hydrostatic pressure gradient along xylem vessels. This pressure gradient leads to a nonuniform pressure difference between the outer solution and the xylem vessels, that increases from the root tips (laterals and primary) to the basal ends (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5</ref> A and D; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">6A</ref>). The radial flow of water shows the same trend along the RSA (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5</ref> C and F; Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">6C</ref>). Consequently, the sap flow rate increases towards the root base leading to a progressive decrease of the solute concentration (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">5</ref> B and E, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">6B</ref>). In osmometer models, this dilution along the RSA is typically neglected. Consequently, these models overestimate the solute concentration inside the xylem compartment, leading to an overestimation of the flow rate. Indeed, ( ) decreases with increasing (overestimated) C, and as consequence ( ) increases in these conditions.</p><p>To illustrate this point, we calculated an analytical solution of the present model, based on equations ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_1">2</ref>) and ( <ref type="formula" target="#formula_3">4</ref>), for a root represented according to Fiscus <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Fiscus, 1975</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Fiscus, , 1977) )</ref> as a simple semipermeable barrier separating two compartments (see Supplementary Protocol S2). The comparisons of the adjusted transport parameters between the RSA model and the twocompartment model show marked differences for CTR and PEG-CTR roots (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_14">S8</ref>). In particular, the radial conductivity k is significantly underestimated in the two-compartment model, by 65 % for CTR roots and 45 % for PEG-CTR roots. In contrast, the solute parameters, J s * and P s , increase dramatically, by 77 and 78 %, respectively, for CTR roots, and by 84 and 88 %, respectively, for PEG-CTR roots. The water and solute transport parameters were noticeably less affected in PEG roots, with changes between 10 and 18 %. This is due to more homogeneous concentration profiles inside these roots because of lower fluxes. For instance, the difference in solute concentration, calculated from the basal end to the tip of the primary root, and divided by its length, was 92.7 ± 29.6, 2.3 ± 0.7 and 12.5 ± 3.0 mol.m -4 , for the CTR, PEG and PEG-CTR roots, respectively. As discussed above, the coupling of solute and water transport in the present root model prevented from significant errors in hydraulic parameter determination. In addition, the model had to represent the possible inflow of PEG in the root vasculature during cut-and-flow experiments. Effects of PEG on both radial osmotic potential differences and sap viscosity had to be modeled throughout RSA.</p><p>To assess these additional modeling constraints, we closely inspected the physiological consistency of data obtained in plants exposed to WD. In brief, both PEG-CTR and PEG plants were submitted to WD during their growth. Yet, the roots of the former plants were exposed to a CTR hydroponic solution for one hour prior to water transport experiments. By contrasts, roots of the latter plants were maintained in a PEG bathing solution during measurements. The axial conductance profiles K of the two series of roots were notably similar. In contrast, and in comparison to PEG roots, the radial conductivity of PEG-CTR roots was reversed to CTR root values. We believe this to be coherent, since K is linked to the xylem vessels that are fixed structures and probably cannot be altered significantly within one hour in a CTR solution. In contrast, k is related to aquaporin activity that can be reversed within this time lapse.</p><p>Whereas our results are in line with studies in numerous species showing WD-induced inhibition of aquaporin activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Maurel et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Rosales et al., 2019)</ref>, they are at variance with the lack of effects of a PEG-induced WD on maize Lp r , as reported by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Hachez et al. (2012)</ref>. Future work will be required to determine to which extent differences in experimental conditions can account for this discrepancy. The precise description of effects of WD on axial conductance also represents a significant advance which will have to be related to effects of drought on root growth and/or xylem differentiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Ramachandran et al., 2020)</ref>. Note that the consistency of axial conductance determination would have not been achieved without considering in detail the viscosity of PEG-containing sap. To illustrate this, let us consider the Hagen-Poiseuille's law which predicts that the conductance of a pipe is inversely proportional to the fluid viscosity. Thus, the axial conductance of a pipe filled with a PEG solution at 150 g/L is 14 times lower than that of the same pipe filled with water (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">S1B</ref>). Indeed, we checked that interpreting the cut-andflow experiments done in a PEG bathing solution with a sap viscosity of 1 mPa.s leads to an underestimation of K by about an order of magnitude.</p></div>
<div><head>Reflection coefficient</head><p>In agreement with the idea that the maize root is permeable to solutes, we set σ to 0.85 in the present root functional model, a value reported in the literature for complete root systems bathing in a nutrient solution (i.e. the nature of the solutes is unknown and nutrients account for all solutes present in solution) <ref type="bibr">(Miller, 1985a</ref>). Yet, we note that in few other works presenting reflection coefficient values for nutrients (non-differentiated solutes), σ was referenced close to unity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Fiscus, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Knipfer et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Knipfer and Fricke, 2010)</ref>. Nevertheless, we further tested the sensitivity of our model inversion method by performing parameter adjustments for σ = 1.0 and 0.5, 0.5 being the lower bound reported for solutes like sucrose in maize primary roots <ref type="bibr">(Steudle, 2000a)</ref>. Our results show that hydraulic parameters were essentially insensitive to σ, and that the two solute A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t parameters were not strongly impacted (Supplementary Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">S6</ref>). These considerations further support the robustness of the model inversion method.</p></div>
<div><head>Conclusion</head><p>In the present work, we have extended the toolbox developed by <ref type="bibr">(Boursiac et al., 2022a)</ref>, combining experiment and modeling to assess the water and solute transport parameters of maize root systems under WD. The experimental data consisted of two successive measurement sets done with a pressure chamber: J v (P) determination, followed by a cut-and-flow experiment. A critical step was to formalize solute transport to account for the specific shape of the J v (P) curve of plants under WD. Furthermore, maize roots grown under WD were investigated under varying measurements conditions, thereby assessing the robustness of our inverse modeling approach. Thus, this novel procedure allows a concomitant determination of water and solute transport parameters and of their alteration upon exposure to WD. In brief, plants grown under WD exhibited, with respect to plants grown under standard conditions, a notable enhancement of axial conductance (K) in root tips. Conversely, the radial conductivity k was reduced tenfold upon direct exposure of roots to WD. Further studies will have to address more complex RSAs considering, for instance, specific hydraulic and solute transport properties in lateral roots and a non-uniform radial conductivity along the root axis. To do so, it may be useful to integrate in the present inverse modeling approach other experimental parameters such as solute concentration in the exuded sap. Finally, our approach can be extended to testing the effects of other environmental factors, such as hypoxia, on water and solute transport in roots.       is the difference between the hydrostatic pressure of the external medium, P e , and the xylem vessel pressure P, in MPa <ref type="bibr">(A and D)</ref>.</p><p>is the difference between solute concentration in the xylem vessels, C, and the external concentration, C e , in mol.m -3 (B and E). j is the local radial flow of water in µL.s -1 .m -2 (D and F).
