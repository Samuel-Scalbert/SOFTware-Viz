<div><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>The performance of machine learning models have mainly been evaluated in terms of utility, that is their ability to solve specific tasks. However, they can be used in sensitive contexts, and impact people's lives. It is thus crucial that users can trust these models. While trustworthiness encompasses multiple concepts, fairness and privacy have attracted a lot of interest in the past few years. Fairness requires models not to unjustly discriminate against specific individuals or subgroups of the population, and privacy preserves individual-level information about the training data from being inferred from the model. These two notions have been extensively studied in isolation: there exists numerous approaches to learn fair models <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Caton &amp; Haas, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mehrabi et al., 2021)</ref>, or to preserve privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Dwork et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Liu et al., 2021)</ref>. However, only few works studied the interplay between privacy and fairness. In this paper, we take a step forward in this direction, proposing a new theoretical bound on the relative impact of privacy on fairness in classification.</p><p>Fairness takes various forms (depending on the task and context), and several definitions exist. On the one hand, the goal may be to ensure that similar individuals are treated similarly. This is captured by individual fairness <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dwork et al., 2012)</ref> and counterfactual fairness <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Kusner et al., 2017)</ref>. On the other hand, group fairness requires that decisions made by machine learning models do not unjustly discriminate against subgroups of the population. In this paper, we focus on group fairness and consider four popular definitions, namely Equalized Odds <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hardt et al., 2016)</ref>, Equality of Opportunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hardt et al., 2016)</ref>, Accuracy Parity <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Zafar et al., 2017)</ref>, and Demographic Parity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Calders et al., 2009)</ref>. Differential privacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dwork, 2006)</ref> has been widely adopted for controlling how much information the output of an algorithm may leak about its input data. It allows publishing machine learning models while preventing an adversary from guessing too confidently the presence (or absence) of an individual in the training data. To enforce differential privacy, one typically releases a noisy estimate of the true model <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dwork, 2006)</ref>, so as to conceal any sensitive information contained in individual data points. This induces a trade-off between the strength of the protection and the utility of the learned model. While this trade-off has been extensively studied <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chaudhuri et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bassily et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Liu et al., 2021)</ref>, its implications for fairness are not yet well understood.</p><p>Contributions. In this work, we quantify the difference in fairness levels between private and non-private models in multi-class classification. We derive high probability bounds showing that this difference shrinks at a rate of O(</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">√ p /n),</formula><p>where n is the number of data records, and p the dimension of the model. To obtain this result, we first prove that the accuracy of a model conditioned on an arbitrary event (such as membership to a sensitive group), is pointwise Lipschitz continuous with respect to the model parameters. This property is inherited by many popular group fairness notions, such as Equalized Odds, Equality of Opportunity, Accuracy Parity and Demographic Parity. Consequently, two sufficiently close models will have similar fairness levels. We then upper-bound the distance between the optimal nonprivate model and the private models obtained with privacy preserving mechanisms like output perturbation <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chaudhuri et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Lowy &amp; Razaviyayn, 2021)</ref> or DP-SGD <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Song et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Bassily et al., 2014)</ref>. These bounds hold for strongly convex empirical risk minimization formulations, potentially allowing explicit fairness-promoting convex regularization terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bechavod &amp; Ligett, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Huang &amp; Vishnoi, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lohaus et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Tran et al., 2021)</ref>. Combining these two results, we derive high probability bounds on the fairness loss due to privacy. They show that, with enough training examples, (i) given an optimal non-private model, enforcing privacy will not harm fairness too much, and (ii) given a private model, the corresponding (unknown) nonprivate optimal model cannot be vastly fairer. Our results also highlight the role of the confidence margin of models in the disparate impact of differential privacy: notably, if the non-private model has high per-group confidence, then our bound on the loss in fairness due to privacy will be smaller.</p><p>Our contributions can be summarized as follows:</p><p>• We prove that group fairness is pointwise Lipschitz, with a smaller constant for models with large margins.</p><p>• We bound the distance between private and optimal models, and show that the difference in their fairness levels decreases in O( √ p /n).</p><p>• We show that this bound can be computed even when the optimal model is unknown, and numerically demonstrate that we obtain non-trivial guarantees.</p><p>Related work. The joint study of fairness and privacy in machine learning only goes back a few years, and has been the focus of a recent survey <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Fioretto et al., 2022)</ref>. One may identify three main research directions. First, it has been empirically observed that privacy can exacerbate unfairness <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bagdasaryan et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Pujol et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Farrand et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Uniyal et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Ganev et al., 2022)</ref> and, conversely, that enforcing fairness can lead to more privacy leakage for the unprivileged group <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chang &amp; Shokri, 2020)</ref>. These empirical results suggest that some properties of the dataset (such as group sizes and groupwise input norms) and the choice of the private training method may affect the extent of these disparate impacts. Unfortunately, these observations are not supported by theoretical results, and it is not clear why and when disparate impact occurs. Second, a few approaches have been proposed to learn models that are both fair and privacy preserving. However, these works either have limited theoretical guarantees on their performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Kilbertus et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Xu et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Tran et al., 2020)</ref>, or learn stochastic models which might not be usable in contexts where deterministic decisions are expected <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Jagielski et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mozannar et al., 2020)</ref>. Finally, a few works have shown that fairness and privacy are incompatible in some settings, in the sense that there exists data distributions where enforcing one prevents the other from being satisfied <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Sanyal et al., 2022)</ref>, or where enforcing both implies trivial utility <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Cummings et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Agarwal, 2020)</ref>. While appealing at first glance, these results usually consider unrealistic cases that are hardly encountered in practice. In this paper, we also study fairness and privacy jointly but rather than studying whether they may be achieved simultaneously, we investigate the relative difference in fairness level between private and non-private models.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the work closest to ours is the one of <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Tran et al. (2021)</ref>. They analyze the impact of privacy on fairness in Empirical Risk Minimization, where their notion of fairness is defined as the difference between the excess risk computed on the overall population and the excess risk computed on a subgroup of the population. They study the expected behavior over the possible private models while our results are model-specific. In line with our work, their results suggest that the distance to the decision boundary plays a key role in the disparate impact of differential privacy. However, the quantity appearing in their result is based on a second-order Taylor approximations which is loose for popular classification loss functions. In contrast, the quantity appearing in our bounds is precisely the confidence margin considered in prior work on multi-class margin-based classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cortes et al., 2013)</ref>. Finally and most importantly, loss-based fairness does not necessarily imply that the actual decisions taken by the model are fair with respect to standard group-fairness notions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Lohaus et al., 2020)</ref>. In contrast, our work provides guarantees in terms of these widely-accepted group fairness definitions.</p></div>
<div><head n="2.">Preliminaries</head><p>In this section, we present the fairness and privacy notions that will be used throughout the paper. We consider a multiclass classification setting with a feature space X , a finite set of labels Y, and a finite set S of values for the sensitive attribute. Let D be a distribution over X × S × Y, and</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">D = {(x 1 , s 1 , y 1 ), . . . , (x n , s n , y n )} be a training set of n examples drawn i.i.d. from D.</formula><p>Let H be a space of realvalued functions h : X × Y → R equipped with a norm • H . For an example x ∈ X , the predicted label is the one with the highest value, that is H(x) = arg max y∈Y h(x, y). In case of a tie, a random label among the most likely ones is predicted.</p><p>The confidence margin <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cortes et al., 2013)</ref> of a model h for an example-label pair (x, y) is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">ρ(h, x, y) = h(x, y) -max y =y h(x, y ) .</formula><p>This confidence margin is positive when the example x is classified as y by h and negative otherwise. In this paper, we make the assumption that the margin is Lipschitz-continuous in the model h.</p><p>Assumption 2.1 (Lipschitzness of the margin). We assume that ρ is Lipschitz-continuous in its first argument, that is for all h, h ∈ H and (x,</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">y) ∈ X × Y, |ρ(h, x, y) -ρ(h , x, y)| ≤ L x,y h -h H ,</formula><p>where L x,y &lt; +∞ may depend on the example (x, y).</p><p>Note that this assumption is not very restrictive. Typically, it holds for any class of differentiable models with either (i) bounded gradients, or (ii) continuous gradients on a compact parameter space (e.g., generalized linear models or smooth deep neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Hastie et al., 2009)</ref>). We stress that L x,y does not need to hold uniformly on the data (although it must hold uniformly on H). Indeed, we will see in our results (Section 3.2) that a large L x,y can be compensated for by the small probability of x, y in the data distribution.</p><p>To illustrate Assumption 2.1, consider linear models of the form h(x, y) = W T y x where W is a real-valued matrix where each line is a vector W y of label-specific parameters. Define</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">h -h H = W -W 2 . Then, remark that |ρ(h, x, y) -ρ(h , x, y)| ≤ |h(x, y) -h (x, y)| + max y =y |h(x, y ) -h (x, y )| ≤ 2 x 2 h -h H . We thus have L x,y = 2 x 2 .</formula><p>The goal of a learning algorithm A : (X × S × Y) n → H is to find the best possible model to solve the task. In this work, the quality of a model h is evaluated through its accuracy Acc(h) = P (H(X) = Y ) but also its fairness level (as defined in Section 2.1). Furthermore, given a non-private algorithm A, our goal will be to compare the quality of its output to that of a private version A priv of A that guarantees differential privacy.</p></div>
<div><head n="2.1.">Fairness</head><p>In this paper, we focus on group fairness. These definitions are based on the idea that a group of individuals should not be discriminated against, compared to the overall population. Usually, these groups are defined by the sensitive attribute from S. However, in some cases, it is necessary to consider more fine grained partitions. This is for example the case in Equalized Odds <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hardt et al., 2016)</ref>, where a model is fair if its performance is the same on the overall population and on subgroups of individuals that share the same sensitive group and the same label. Thus, for the sake of generality, we assume that the data can be partitioned into K disjoint groups denoted by D 1 , . . . , D k , . . . , D K . As in Maheshwari &amp; Perrot (2022), we consider fairness definitions that, for each group k, can be written as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">F k (h, D) = C 0 k + K k =1 C k k P (H(X) = Y | D k ) ,<label>(1)</label></formula><p>where the C k k 's are group specific values independent of h, that typically depend on the size of the groups. In Ap-pendix A, we show that usual group fairness notions such as Demographic Parity (with binary labels) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Calders et al., 2009)</ref>, Equality of Opportunity <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hardt et al., 2016)</ref>, Equalized Odds <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Hardt et al., 2016)</ref>, and Accuracy Parity <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Zafar et al., 2017)</ref> can all be expressed in the form of (1). By convention, we consider that F k (h, D) &gt; 0 when the group k is advantaged by h compared to the overall population, F k (h, D) &lt; 0 when the group is disadvantaged and F k (h, D) = 0 when h is fair for group k.</p><p>In some cases, rather than measuring fairness for each group k independently, it is interesting to summarize the information with an aggregate value. For example, we will use the mean of the absolute fairness level of each group:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">Fair(h, D) = 1 K K k=1 |F k (h, D)| ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>which is 0 when h is fair and positive when it is unfair.</p></div>
<div><head n="2.2.">Differential Privacy</head><p>We measure the privacy of machine learning models with differential privacy (see Definition 2.2 below). Differential privacy (DP) guarantees that the outcomes of a randomized algorithm are similar when run on datasets that differ in at most one data point. It effectively preserves privacy by preventing an adversary observing the trained model from inferring the presence of an individual in the training set. A key property of differential privacy is that it still holds after post-processing of the algorithm's outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Dwork, 2006)</ref>, as long as this post-processing is independent of the data. Let D, D ∈ (X × S × Y) n be two datasets of n elements. We say that they are neighboring (denoted by D ≈ D ) if they differ in at most one element.</p><p>Definition 2.2 (Differential Privacy - <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Dwork (2006)</ref>). Let A priv : (X × S × Y) n → H be a randomized algorithm. We say that A priv is ( , δ)-differentially private if, for all neighboring datasets D, D ∈ (X ×S ×Y) n and all subsets of hypotheses H ⊆ H,</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">P(A priv (D) ∈ H ) ≤ exp( ) P(A priv (D ) ∈ H ) + δ .</formula><p>To design differentially private algorithms to estimate a function A : (X × S × Y) n → R p , we need to quantify how much changing one point in a dataset can impact the output of A. This is typically measured by (an upper bound on) the 2 -sensitivity of A, defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">∆(A) = sup D≈D A(D) -A(D ) 2 .</formula><p>The value of A on a dataset D ∈ (X × S × Y) n can then be released privately using the Gaussian mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Dwork et al., 2014)</ref>. Formally, to guarantee ( , δ)-differential privacy, we add Gaussian noise to A(D), calibrated to its sensitivity and the desired level of privacy:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">A priv (D) = A(D) + N 0, 2∆(A) 2 log(1.25/δ) 2 I p ,</formula><p>where N (0, σ 2 I p ) is a sample from the normal distribution with mean zero and variance σ 2 I p . In many cases (e.g., when the dataset D is large), A priv is computed on a random subsample of D. Assuming A priv is ( , δ)differentially private, applying A priv to a randomly selected fraction q of D satisfies (O(q ), qδ)-differential privacy, thereby amplifying privacy guarantees <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Kasiviswanathan et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Beimel et al., 2014)</ref>. This privacy amplification by subsampling phenomenon, together with the Gaussian mechanism, serve as building blocks in more complex algorithms. In particular, they can be composed <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Dwork et al., 2014)</ref>, allowing the design of iterative private algorithms such as DP-SGD <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Bassily et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abadi et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div><head n="3.">Pointwise Lipschitzness and Group Fairness</head><p>Here, we show that several group fairness notions are pointwise Lipschitz with respect to the model. To this end, we first prove a more general result on the pointwise Lipschitzness of accuracy conditionally on an arbitrary event.</p></div>
<div><head n="3.1.">Pointwise Lipschitzness of Conditional Accuracy</head><p>We first relate the difference of conditional accuracy of two models to the distance that separates them. This is summarized in the next theorem.</p><p>Theorem 3.1 (Pointwise Lipschitzness of Conditional Accuracy). Let H be a set of real-valued functions with L X,Y the Lipschitz constants defined in Assumption 2.1. Let h, h ∈ H be two models, (X, Y, S) be a triple of random variables with distribution D, and E be an arbitrary event.</p><p>Assume that</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">E ( L X,Y / ρ(h , X, Y ) | E) &lt; +∞, then |P(H(X) = Y | E) -P(H (X) = Y | E)| ≤ E L X,Y |ρ(h, X, Y )| E h -h H . (Lip)</formula><p>Proof. (Sketch) The proof of this theorem is in two steps. First, we use the Lipschitzness of the margin (Assumption 2.1), the triangle inequality, and the union bound to</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">show that |P (H(X) = Y | E) -P (H (X) = Y | E)| ≤ P ( L X,Y /|ρ(h, X, Y )| ≥ 1 / h -h H | E).</formula><p>Then, applying Markov's inequality gives the desired result. The complete proof can be found in Appendix B.</p><p>Theorem 3.1 shows the pointwise lipschitzness of the function h → P (H(X) = Y | E) and underlines the importance of the confidence margin ρ(h, x, y) of the model h. Note that Lx,y /|ρ(h, x, y)| is small when the model h is confident (relatively to L x,y ) in its prediction for the true label y. This implies that, when the probability (given E) that a point has a small margin (relatively to L x,y ) is small,</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">E L X,Y |ρ(h,X,Y</formula><p>)| E is also small. This is notably the case for large margin classifiers.</p><p>Additionally, we note that data records that are unlikely do not affect the result too much. Indeed, even if Lx,y /|ρ(h, x, y)| is large, this can be compensated for by the small probability of observing x, y so that the value of</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">E L X,Y |ρ(h,X,Y )| E is not significantly affected.</formula><p>It is worth noting that the bound presented in Theorem 3.1 can be tightened (at the expense of readability) without affecting the quantities that need to be controlled, that is the margin |ρ(h, x, y)| and the distance hh H . Hence, note that given</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">(x, y) ∈ X × Y, if |ρ(h, x, y)| ≥ L x,y h -h H ,</formula><p>then it means that h's margin is large enough to ensure that h and h have the same prediction on x. The corresponding term in the expectation may then be accounted for as zero, improving the upper bound (Remark B.2). Interestingly, if all the examples are classified with such a large margin, our bound becomes 0, further hinting toward the importance of large margin classifiers. This result may be further tightened by using a Chernoff bound instead of Markov's inequality</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">(Remark B.1), yield- ing |P(H(X) = Y |E)-P(H (X) = Y |E)| ≤ β X,Y (h), with β X,Y (h) = inf t≥0 e t h-h H E e - t|ρ(h,X,Y )| L X,Y E .</formula><p>In the subsequent theoretical developments, we use the bound derived in Theorem 3.1 for the sake of readability. In the numerical experiments (Section 5), we use the version of the bound that yields the tightest results by combining both of the aforementioned techniques.</p></div>
<div><head n="3.2.">Pointwise Lipschitzness of Group Fairness Notions</head><p>We now use Theorem 3.1's general result to relate the fairness levels of two classifiers, based on their distance. In Theorem 3.2, we show that fairness notions in the form of (1) are pointwise Lipschitz. Theorem 3.2 (Pointwise Lipschitzness of Fairness). Let h, h ∈ H, and L X,Y defined as in Assumption 2.1. For any fairness notion of the form of (1), we have, for all k ∈ [K],</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">|F k (h, D) -F k (h , D)| ≤ χ k (h, D) h -h H . with χ k (h, D) = K k =1 C k k E L X,Y |ρ(h,X,Y )| D k . Simi- larly, for the aggregate measure of fairness defined in (2), |Fair(h, D)-Fair(h , D)| ≤ 1 K K k=1 χ k (h, D) h -h H .</formula><p>Proof. (Sketch) To prove the first claim, we use the triangle inequality to show that, for each group, the absolute differ-ence in fairness is bounded by a combination of absolute differences between conditional probabilities. We can then apply Theorem 3.1. The second claim follows by applying the first one to each group independently. The complete proof is provided in Appendix C.</p><p>Theorem 3.2 implies that classifiers that are sufficiently close have similar fairness levels. This has two major consequences when studying a given model. On the one hand, we have an upper bound on the harm that can be done to fairness: small variations of the model cannot make it much more unfair. On the other hand, we have a lower bound on the distance needed to make a model fair: making the model significantly more fair requires to substantially alter it. In the next corollary, we instantiate Theorem 3.2 for various popular group fairness notions, and for accuracy.</p><p>Corollary 3.3. Let h, h ∈ H, and L X,Y defined as in Assumption 2.1.

We will use this result in Section 4, where we bound the disparate impact of privacy by bounding the difference in fairness levels between private and non-private models.</p><p>Finite sample analysis.

Conversely, it increases with the complexity of the model (i.e., with larger dimension p), and with the Lipschitz constant of the loss Λ.</p><p>Remark 4.3. For clarity of exposition in Lemma 4.2, we did not use minimal assumptions and used the simplest variant of DP-SGD.

<div><head n="4.2.">Bounding the Fairness of Private Models</head><p>We now state our central result (Theorem 4.4), where we bound the fairness of h priv relatively to the one of h * .</p><p>Theorem 4.4. Let h * be the solution of (3), and h priv its private estimate obtained by output perturbation. Let h ref ∈ {h priv , h * }, and 0 &lt; ζ &lt; 1.

By Lemma 4.1 or Lemma 4.2, we control the distance h privh * . Plugging this bound in Theorem 3.2 gives the result.</p><p>This result shows that, when learning a private model, the unfairness due to privacy vanishes at a O( √ p /n) rate. To the best of our knowledge, our result is the first to quantify this rate. Importantly, it highlights the role of the confidence margin of the classifier on the disparate impact of differential privacy. This is in line with previous empirical and theoretical work that identified the groupwise distances to the decision boundary as an important factor <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Tran et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Fioretto et al., 2022)</ref>. However, our bounds are the first to quantify this impact through a classic notion of confidence margin studied in learning theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Cortes et al., 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Our result may be interpreted and used in various ways. A first example is the case where the private model is known but its optimal non-private counterpart is not. There, our result guarantees that, given enough examples, the fairness level of the private model is close to the one of the optimal non-private model. This allows the practitioner to give guarantees on the model, that the end user can trust. A second example is the case where the true model h * is owned by someone who cannot share it, due to privacy concerns.</p><p>Imagine that the model needs to be audited for fairness.</p><p>Then, the model owner can compute a private estimate of their model, and send it to the (honest but curious) auditing company. The bound allows to obtain fairness bounds for the true model from the inspection of the private one, and thus acts as a certificate of correctness of the audit done on the private version of the model.</p><p>Remark 4.5. The fairness guarantee for the private model given by Theorem 4.4 is relative to the fairness of the optimal model h * , which may itself be quite unfair. A standard approach to promote fair models is to use convex relaxations of fairness as regularizers to the ERM problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bechavod &amp; Ligett, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Huang &amp; Vishnoi, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Lohaus et al., 2020)</ref>. Interestingly, to be able to use output perturbation, we only require the objective function of (3) to be strongly convex and Lipschitz over h ∈ H, which is the case for these relaxations when they are combined with a squared 2 -norm. For binary classification with two sensitive groups, Lohaus et al.</p><p>(2020) proved that, with a proper choice of regularization parameters, this approach can yield a fair h * (see their Theorem 1 for more details). Combined with our results, this paves the way for the design of algorithms that learn provably private and fair classifiers. However, several crucial challenges remain to make this approach work in practice, such as (i) finding the appropriate regularization parameters privately, and (ii) providing guarantees on the resulting classifiers' accuracy. We leave this for future work.</p></div>
<div><head n="5.">Numerical Experiments</head><p>In this section, we numerically illustrate the upper bounds from Section 4.2. We use the celebA <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Liu et al., 2015)</ref> and folktables <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ding et al., 2021)</ref> datasets, which respectively contain 202, 599 and 1, 664, 500 samples, with 39 and 10 features (including one sensitive attribute, sex, that is not not used for prediction), and binary labels. For each dataset, we use 90% of the records for training, and the remaining 10% for empirical evaluation of the bounds. We train 2 -regularized logistic regression models, ensuring that the underlying optimization problem is 1-strongly-convex. This allows learning private models by output perturbation, for which the bound from Theorem 4.4 holds.<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> </p><p>In Section 5.1, we show that we obtain non-trivial guarantees on the private model's fairness and accuracy.

In all cases, our results give non-trivial guarantees on the difference of fairness: it is bounded by at most 0.105 for celebA and 0.0026 for folktables. This means that any (1, 1/n 2 )-DP model learned by output perturbation will, with high probability, achieve a fairness level within this margin of that of the non-private model.</p></div>
<div><head n="5.2.">Influence of the Number of Training Samples and Privacy Budget</head><p>We now verify numerically the rate at which fairness and accuracy levels decrease when increasing the number of training records or privacy budget. In Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, we plot the optimal model's equality of opportunity and accuracy, as a function of (i) in the first line, the number of samples n used for training, or (ii) in the second line, the privacy budget (see Appendix G for results with other fairness measures).</p><p>For each value of n and , we plot Theorem 4.4's theoretical guarantees (solid blue line). With = 1, our bounds give meaningful guarantees for n ≥ 100, 000 records on both celebA and folktables datasets (Figures <ref type="figure">1a to 1d</ref>). When using all records, we obtain meaningful bounds for ≥ 1 for celebA and ≥ 0.1 for folktables (Figures 1e to 1h). Additionally, note that we obtain both upper and lower bounds on fairness and accuracy, confirming remarks from Section 3.2.</p><p>We also report the fairness and accuracy levels of 100 private models computed by output perturbation (in green in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). As predicted by our theory, their fairness and accuracy converges towards the ones of their non-private counterparts as n and increase. Interestingly, our bounds seem to follow the same tendency as what we observe empirically (albeit with a larger multiplicative constant), suggesting that they capture the correct dependence in n and . We further discuss the tightness of our results in next section.</p></div>
<div><head n="5.3.">Tightness of the Bound</head><p>We now argue that the two major factors of looseness in our results are (i) the upper bound on h privh * and (ii) the looseness of Assumption 2.1. While these cannot be improved in general, specific knowledge of h priv and h * (that is typically not available due to privacy) can lead to tighter bounds. First, when the distance h privh * is known, we can use its actual value rather than the upper bounds of Section 4.1 (see dashed blue line in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). Second, when both h priv and h * are known, Assumption 2.1 can be substantially refined (see details in Appendix G.3). We evaluate this bound for the private model that is the farthest away from the non-private one (see dotted blue line in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>). The resulting bound appears to be tight up to a small multiplicative constant. These two observations suggest that our bounds cannot be significantly tightened, unless one can obtain such knowledge through either private computation or additional assumptions on the data.</p></div>
<div><head n="6.">Conclusion</head><p>In this work, we proved that the fairness (and accuracy) costs induced by privacy in differentially private classification vanishes at a O( √ p /n) rate, where n is the number of training records, and p the number of parameters. This rate follows from a general statement on the regularity of a family of group fairness measures, that we prove to be pointwise Lipschitz with respect to the model. The pointwise Lipschitz constant explicitly depends on the confidence margin of the model, and may be different for each sensitive group. We also show it can be computed from a finite data sample. Importantly, our bounds do not require the knowledge of the optimal (non-private) model: they can thus be used in practical privacy-preserving scenarios. We numerically evaluate our bounds on real datasets, and highlight practical settings where non-trivial guarantees can be obtained.</p><p>While we illustrated our results for output perturbation and DP-SGD on strongly-convex problems, we stress that they are more general. Indeed, our Theorem 3.2 holds for any pair of models. Consequently, it would apply to DP-SGD on non-convex problems, provided that we have a bound on the distance between the models obtained with and without privacy. Deriving a tight bound on this distance is a challenging problem, that constitutes an interesting future direction.</p><p>Finally, we stress that our results do not provide fairness guarantees per se, but only bound the difference of fairness between models. It is nonetheless a first step towards a more complete understanding of the interplay between privacy, fairness, and accuracy. We believe that our results can guide the design of fairer privacy-preserving machine learning algorithms. A first promising direction in this regard is to combine our bounds with fairness-promoting convex regularizers, as discussed in Remark 4.5. Another direction is the design of methods to privately learn models with large-margin guarantees, as recently considered by <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Bassily et al. (2022)</ref>. Our results, which explicitly depend on the confidence margin of the model, suggest that better fairness guarantees could be obtained for these methods.</p><p>This appendix provides several examples of group fairness functions compatible with our framework (Appendix A), the proofs of the main theoretical results that were omitted in the main paper for the sake of readability (Appendices B to F), and additional experiments (Appendix G).</p></div>

Experimental Setup</head><p>The celebA dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Liu et al., 2015)</ref> is a face attributes dataset, that can be downloaded at http://mmlab.ie.cuhk. edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html, and the folktables dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ding et al., 2021)</ref> is derived from US Census, and can be downloaded using a Python package available here https://github.com/zykls/folktables.</p><p>On each dataset, for each value of n, we train a 2 -regularized logistic regression model using scikit-learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Pedregosa et al., 2011)</ref>. Private models are then learned using the output perturbation mechanism as described in Section 4.1. We then compute our bounds using the non-private model as reference, over a test set containing 10% of the data, that has not been used for training (containing 20, 260 records for celebA and 166, 450 records for folktables). The value of the bound is computed by minimizing the experession given by the Chernoff bound using the golden section search algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Kiefer, 1953)</ref>. The <software ContextAttributes="shared">code</software> is in the supplementary, and will be made public.</p><p>For the plots with different number of training records, we train 20 non-private models with a number of records logarithmically spaced between 10 and the number of records in the complete training set (that is, 182, 339 for celebA and 1, 498, 050 for folktables). For the plots with different privacy budgets, we use 20 values logarithmically spaced between 10 -3 and 10 for both datasets.</p></div>
<div><head>G.2. Results for Other Fairness Measures</head><p>Our bounds also hold for accuracy parity, demographic parity and equalized odds. The same plots as those presented in Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref> for these fairness notions are in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> and Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>. The comments from Section 5 on equality of opportunity and accuracy also hold for these three notions of fairness.  G.3. Refined Bounds with Additional Knowledge of h priv and h *</p><p>In Assumption 2.1, we use a uniform Lipschitz bound for all h, h ∈ H. Let's consider the class H of linear models, where, for h ∈ H, we denote by h y the parameters of h associated with the label y, that is h(x, y) = h T y x.
