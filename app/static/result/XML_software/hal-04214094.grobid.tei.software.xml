<div><p>The research carried out so far in detecting abusive content in social media has primarily focused on overt forms of hate speech. While explicit hate speech (HS) is more easily identifiable by recognizing hateful words, messages containing linguistically subtle and implicit forms of HS (as circumlocution, metaphors and sarcasm) constitute a real challenge for automatic systems. While the sneaky and tricky nature of subtle messages might be perceived as less hurtful with respect to the same content expressed clearly, such abuse is at least as harmful as overt abuse. In this paper, we first provide an in-depth and systematic analysis of 7 standard benchmarks for HS detection, relying on a fine-grained and linguistically-grounded definition of implicit and subtle messages. Then, we experiment with state-of-the-art neural network architectures on two supervised tasks, namely implicit HS and subtle HS message classification. We show that while such models perform satisfactory on explicit messages, they fail to detect implicit and subtle content, highlighting the fact that HS detection is not a solved problem and deserves further investigation.</p></div>

<div><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The rising mass of communication through social media further exacerbates harmful consequences of online hate speech. As a result, social media have faced mounting pressure from civil rights groups demanding to ramp up their enforcement of antihate speech policies, so that to monitor and limit this kind of content. In the latest years, numerous methods have been developed to automatically identify this type of utterances expressing hateful or abusive content on social media using Natural Language Processing methods. A variety of datasets have also been built, exemplifying various manifestations of this harmful content <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Poletto et al., 2021)</ref>. However, most of the research carried out so far on this topic has focused on overt forms of hate speech. Explicit hate speech is more easily identifiable by recognizing a clearly hateful word or phrase. Only recently, a few works <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hartvigsen et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Wiegand et al., 2022</ref><ref type="bibr">Wiegand et al., , 2021a;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">ElSherief et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Jurgens et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Waseem et al., 2017)</ref> have started to focus on implicitness, where circumlocution, metaphor, or stereotypes are used to intentionally convey hatred towards a particular group. In those messages, hatefulness can be captured only by understanding their global meaning, as well as contextual information.</p><p>In this paper, we carry out an in-depth analysis of implicit HS in standard benchmarks for HS detection. Additionally, we define the notion of Subtle HS that puts forward hateful meanings elusively relying on human perception and through the use of complex syntactic structures. In our study, we collect messages from 7 available datasets for HS detection that cover different topics and are extracted from different social media platforms, and we enrich them with the following three-layer annotation: HS/non HS, Explicit/Implicit and Subtle/Non Subtle. We also provide a fine-grained annotation for implicit HS messages with 18 implicit properties such as irony, exaggeration, metaphor, and rhetorical question, among others. The newly created resource named ISHate (Implicit and Subtle Hate speech) provides a rich and variegate benchmark for pushing forward research on implicit and subtle hateful messages, and constitutes a challenging test-bed to evaluate computational approaches. <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref>Additionally, we evaluate SOTA and competitive baseline classifiers to detect both implicit and subtle HS in ISHate, showing that current methods fail to effectively detect implicit and subtle HS messages due to their peculiar nature. NOTE: This paper contains examples of language which may be offensive to some readers. They do not represent the views of the authors.</p></div>
<div><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>In the latest years, there has been significant research on abusive language and hate speech detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Xu et al.

(2020</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Caselli et al. ( , 2021))</ref>). A few works focus on subtypes of HS, such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Warner and Hirschberg (2012)</ref> that tackles the recognition of antisemitism, or <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Waseem and Hovy (2016)</ref>; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Badjatiya et al. (2017)</ref>; Gambäck and Sikdar (2017) that investigate predictive features to identify HS in the form of racism and sexism. In this context, several challenges and shared tasks have also been organized over the years, that made datasets and resources for multiple languages available (for a survey, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Poletto et al. (2021)</ref>). Research studies carried out so far have mostly focused on overt forms of hate speech, while very few works address the issue of implicit and subtle HS <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(ElSherief et al., 2021)</ref>. However, several works show awareness of the problem. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Warner and Hirschberg (2012)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Xu et al. (2012)</ref> discuss systems' limitations in identifying HS messages which are ambiguous, have patterns of emotional speech or lack context. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">Zhang and Luo (2018)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Corazza et al. (2020)</ref> highlight the complexity of recognizing hateful messages when the meaning is conveyed through sarcasm, stereotypes, complex syntactic structure, or non-explicit lexical patterns.</p><p>Among the few studies that attempted to address the issues of implicit and subtle detection, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Caselli et al. (2020)</ref> defines a shared task to detect implicit and explicit abusive messages from <software ContextAttributes="used">AbusEval</software>, a reannotated dataset based on OLID/<software ContextAttributes="used">OffensEval</software> <ref type="bibr">(Zampieri et al., 2019a)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Benikova et al.

Even though these studies set the basis to explore and model the issue of implicit HS, there is still large room for improvement, both in terms of creating adequate resources to investigate these aspects and in terms of computational approaches to address them.</p></div>
<div><head n="3">HS, Implicitness and Subtlety</head><p>Hate Speech is defined as a direct attack against people -rather than concepts or institutionsbased on protected characteristics (PC): race, ethnicity, national origin, disability, religious affiliation, caste, sexual orientation, sex, gender identity, and severe disease <ref type="bibr">(Meta, 2022)</ref>. We encompass in the concept refugees, migrants, immigrants, asylum seekers from the most severe attacks, and occupations when they are referenced along with PC, though commentary and criticism of immigration policies are excluded from HS. Following this definition, HS differs from related concepts mainly since it is specifically oriented to groups of people with PC as the main target <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Poletto et al., 2021)</ref>. In the following, we provide clear and operational definitions of explicit, implicit and subtle HS. Reported examples are extracted from the White Supremacy Forum (WSF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(de Gibert et al., 2018)</ref> and the CONAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chung et al., 2019)</ref> datasets, described in Section 4.</p></div>
<div><head n="3.1">Explicit Hate Speech</head><p>Explicit HS is unambiguous in its potential to be abusive/hateful, such as language containing racial or homophobic slurs. Explicit HS uses words whose literal definition (taken from the dictionary) is hateful <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(ElSherief et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Waseem et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Caselli et al., 2020)</ref>, as in Example 1.</p><p>1. Negros are so dumb . (WSF)</p></div>
<div><head n="3.2">Implicit Hate Speech</head><p>According to the definitions of <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">ElSherief et al. (2021)</ref>, implicit HS does not immediately denote abuse/hate. Implicitness goes beyond word-related meaning, implying figurative language use such as <ref type="bibr">irony, sarcasm, etc. (ElSherief et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Benikova et al., 2018)</ref>, generally hiding the real meaning, making it more difficult to grasp and undermining the collection of hateful messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hartvigsen et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Waseem et al., 2017)</ref>. Therefore, we deal with figurative meaning intended by the author rather than literal meaning of words that may be extracted from dictionaries.</p><p>In our extensive study on hate speech datasets, we identified 18 typical properties of implicitness relying on linguistics features (listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). Among the most significant ones we have irony <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Frenda et al., 2022)</ref>, sarcasm <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Potamias et al., 2020)</ref>, black humor, metaphor <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Choi et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Gao et al., 2018)</ref>, exaggeration <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Troiano et al., 2018)</ref>, rhetorical question, sentiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Li et al., 2021)</ref>, inference, lack of context <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dadvar et al., 2013)</ref>, and lack of extralinguistic knowledge. Most of the implicit HS messages contain combinations of several properties, as in: 2. Global Jewry did not want Brexit and are doing everything they can to sabotage it. (CO-NAN)</p><p>Example 2 illustrates an interlacement of irony and exaggeration. Global Jewry represents a wordplay mixing Global Jury and Jews adding humorous content to the perception of Jewish people as a nation, while doing everything is hyperbolic pointing out that Jewish are extremely occupied by Brexit.</p><p>The whole message is ironical as it emphasizes that Israel has its own interest in other country's affairs.</p><p>3. I also , unfortuantely , spent 7-8th grade in a 95 % monkey house (WSF)</p><p>In Example 3 there is an overlap of irony, exaggeration, and metaphor (underlined). 95 % looks more like an exaggeration than a fact, while monkey house refers to the group of students and in the metaphor due to their skin color they are compared with monkeys.</p><p>4. Are you sure that Islam is a peaceful religion? (CONAN)</p><p>Example 4 interlaces rhetorical question, inference, and sentiment. The rhetorical question doubts about the peacefulness of Islam, expressing at the same time the author's take on it. As well as that, we may read negative inference between the lines.</p></div>
<div><head n="3.3">Subtle Hate Speech</head><p>Subtle Hate Speech concerns hateful messages that are so delicate or elusive as to be difficult to analyze or describe, and that depend on an indirect method to deliver the meaning (Merriam-Webster, 2022). However, literal meanings <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Roland et al., 1968;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bertrand, 1905)</ref> are of prime importance in subtle messages by contrast to implicit messages where we go beyond literal meanings <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(Waseem et al., 2017)</ref>. Although implicitness and subtlety differ a lot at this point, we still rely on language users' perception <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Grice, 1967</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Grice, , 1989;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Korta and Perry, 2020)</ref> to understand implicit and subtle messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Benikova et al., 2018)</ref>. Despite the challenges in characterizing human perception schematically, in our study, the use of elements such as negations with positive clauses, conditionals, connectors, unrelated constructions, word order, and circumlocution can greatly affect the subtlety of a message. Cases of HS that convey the meaning directly and straightforwardly are non-subtle. As subtlety is even less studied than implicitness in the domain of HS <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Breitfeller et al., 2019)</ref>, and only considered as a related concept of implicitness in previous works <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Jurgens et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">ElSherief et al., 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Hartvigsen et al., 2022)</ref>, we analyze their interrelation, particularly whether one of these concepts is an umbrella term for the other.</p><p>First, we study whether explicit HS can convey the meaning in a subtle way, to accept or reject the idea that implicitness is a general term for subtlety. As can be seen from the example below, a message can be explicit and subtle at the same time: 5. As a brit my knowledge of american law is somewhat lacking but even i know that this holder groid has committed treason (WSF)</p><p>Example 5 is explicit as it literally conveys hateful meanings with the expression holder groid, but it is subtle as the intended hateful meaning is disguised by the first and second underlined constructions, pushing out the attention from the explicit hateful expression.</p><p>On the other side, we investigate whether subtlety is an umbrella concept for implicitness (whether all implicit messages are subtle by default). The following example shows an implicit non-subtle HS message: 6. I 'm either in North Florida or Nigeria sometimes i can't tell the difference. (WSF)</p><p>According to the definitions of explicitness and implicitness, this message is not explicit since it does not contain any hateful words, thus, it does not directly convey hateful meaning. However, it is hateful despite being more elaborated, as it includes certain figures of speech that trigger hateful meaning. The underlined expression in Example 6 represents antithesis, while the message itself is ironical. This message also lacks contextual information and extralinguistic knowledge. Although being implicit, this message is not subtle as the meaning is delivered plainly without any delusion or delicacy. Based on these considerations, we consider implicitness and subtlety as two separate concepts. To illustrate the difference between implicit non-subtle messages presented above and implicit subtle cases, consider the following example:</p><p>7. I think it is a bit late to think to look after the saety and the future of white people in Southfrica . (WSF)</p><p>We label it as implicit HS as it does not express hateful meaning explicitly via offensive words and it is ironic. It is also subtle as it starts with an introductory construction that makes the message more sophisticated and adds extra weight to it.</p><p>As can be expected, it is also possible to find non-hateful subtle or implicit sentences (such as ironic or sentimental texts). However, our work focuses on exploring implicitness and subtlety in the context of hate speech only, therefore those more general cases are not investigated.</p></div>
<div><head n="4">The ISHate Dataset</head><p>Relying on the fine-grained definitions of HS provided in the previous section (explicit, implicit and subtle HS), we collect and enrich 7 available standard datasets for HS detection. As a result, we create the first benchmark for implicit and subtle HS detection on social media messages extracted from different sources.</p></div>
<div><head n="4.1">Data Collection</head><p>Nearly all available resources of user-generated HS content are retrieved with a keyword-based approach, and mainly relying on a list of words with negative polarity <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Poletto et al., 2021)</ref>. However, with this strategy it is possible to extract mainly explicit HS expressions (as in the <software ContextAttributes="used">AbusEval</software> dataset, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Caselli et al. (2020)</ref>). Given that our study focuses on implicit and subtle HS, we prefer to explore resources collected from communities of users that are potentially prone to hate speech, or resources manually created using a systematic approach. In the following, we list the considered resources: White Supremacy Forum Dataset (WSF) (de <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Gibert et al., 2018)</ref>, that contains HS messages from Stormfront, scraped from the most influential white supremacist forum on the Web. The database is arranged in sub-forums and conversation threads. <ref type="bibr"><software>HatEval</software> (Basile et al., 2019)</ref>, which is among the most well-known benchmark for HS detection. A combined approach is applied to collect hateful and misogynous tweets by monitoring potential victims of hate accounts, downloading the history of identified haters, and filtering Twitter streams with both neutral and derogatory keywords. Implicit Hate Corpus (IHC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(ElSherief et al., 2021)</ref>, annotated with explicit HS, implicit HS, and non-HS labels obtained from online hate groups on Twitter. The authors focused on eight ideological clusters of U.S., as Black Separatists, White Nationalist and Neo-Nazi. From this dataset we only extracted messages labeled as implicit HS, as it is one of our target categories. ToxiGen <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hartvigsen et al., 2022)</ref>, a dataset with benign and implicit toxic messages against minority groups. ToxiGen is machine-generated through the GPT3 language model and prompt programming. Similarly to IHC, we only extracted messages which were automatically labeled as implicit HS and human-validated as toxic by the authors. We did not consider unfinished generated sentences which make a part of implicit messages. YouTube Video Comments Dataset (YouTube) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Hammer, 2017)</ref>, that consists of YouTube comments posted under videos related to religion and politics. Differently from the other resources, the messages are annotated as "violent" or "clean". CONAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Chung et al., 2019)</ref>, a dataset of HS messages and counter-narratives (CN) pairs for CN generation. Two native English speakers were asked to write 50 prototypical short texts, which NGO could later use to write their hate texts and counternarratives. We believe that messages for which a CN can be provided might be richer in implicit content since a slur-based explicit HS message might produce very poor argumentative CN. Multi-Target CONAN (MCONAN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Fanton et al., 2021)</ref>, a dataset of English HS/CN pairs comprising several hate targets. It is collected using a Human-in-the-Loop approach. A generative lan-guage model is refined iteratively by using data from the previous loops to generate new samples that NGOs experts review.</p><p>Before starting the annotation process with the fine-grained annotations (Explicit, Implicit and Subtle HS), we had to make sure that the definition of HS originally used to annotate such resources is consistent with ours. In the first annotation round, we checked the messages originally annotated as HS, and discarded the few ones that did not correspond to the definition of HS reported in Section 3. For the YouTube dataset, we also added the HS labels. While all the messages annotated as HS are directed to PC, it should be noted that the topics distribution and the writing quality might be different, given the heterogeneity of the selected resources. HS messages mostly target Islamism, Judaism, misogyny, multi-culturalism, racism, immigration, and refugees. Regarding time creation, WSF is made from threads posted between 2002 and 2017, ToxiGen's LM was trained with messages from 2016 to 2019, Hateval consists of messages of 2018, the YouTube comments were collected in 2017, while the IHC contains tweets from U.S. ideological clusters from 2015 to 2017.</p></div>
<div><head n="4.2">Annotation Procedure</head><p>Following the annotation scheme described in Section 3, four graduate-level annotators with linguistics and computational linguistics competences carried out a pilot annotation study on a sample of 100 messages extracted from each of the above mentioned resources to converge to non-ambiguous annotation strategies. We calculate the Inter Annotator Agreement (IAA) on this sample, resulting in Cohen's κ=0.793 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Cohen, 1960)</ref> for the implicit layer (binary annotation Explicit/Implicit) and 0.730 for the subtlety layer (binary annotation Subtle/Non-Subtle). We also compute the IAA considering both layers simultaneously, that is, considering one layer of 4 classes (Implicit, Explicit, Subtle, Non-Subtle), obtaining a Cohen's κ of 0.734. In the reconciliation phase, we notice that most of the disagreements are due to the interlacement of subtlety and implicitness. For that reason, we also calculate an ordered weighted disagreement using Krippendorff's α to penalize less when the annotators agree at least on one of the layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Artstein and Poesio, 2008)</ref>. The Krippendorff's α is 0.757. Despite the complexity of the annotation task, obtained results are considered as strong agreement in a two-annotators setting. The rest of the annotations has then been carried out by two of the annotators mentioned above, which were provided with the final version of the annotation guidelines (containing the definitions of the target classes, i.e., subtlety and implicitness, and a discussion about borderline cases), together with a set of labeled examples.</p><p>Finally, the implicit properties annotations are added on top of the messages labeled as implicit as an additional annotation layer to highlight 18 linguistic features that implicitly convey hateful meaning. For this layer, annotations are carried out by one expert linguist.</p></div>
<div><head n="4.3">Data Statistics</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> shows statistics of the final dataset, reporting on the number of annotated HS messages for each resource and for the three annotation layers.</p><p>The ISHate collection consists of a total of 29116 messages, where 11247 are HS (further annotated with the Explicit/Implicit and Subtle/Non-subtle labels). For computational purposes, we provide a dataset split in three subsets, i.e., train (70%), validation (15%), and test (15%) sets. Each of the partition respects the distribution of all the annotation layers using stratified splitting. As can be seen, classes are unbalanced, each resource providing only a reduced number of implicit and subtle messages -as expected. Note that CONAN and MCONAN do not contain Non-HS messages, because their main objective is CN generation. As for IHC and ToxiGen, we only look through previously annotated implicit HS messages disregarding non hateful ones. Note also that ToxiGen claimed to contain only implicit adversarial messages, but according to our definitions and annotation guidelines many messages are considered as explicit and non-subtle by our annotators.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> shows the full distribution of the implicit properties relative to the implicit messages in ISHate. As it can be seen, Inference (58%), Context (48%), Sentiment (45%), Exaggeration (28%) and Irony (22%), are the most frequent properties of implicit HS messages, whereas Euphemism (4%), Circumlocution (3%), Metonymy (0.4%) and Synecdoche (0.08%) are the least recurrent. Note that one implicit message can be labeled with more than one property. </p></div>
<div><head n="4.4">Data Augmentation</head><p>To overcome the problem of the unbalanced dataset, we propose oversampling and data augmentation (DA) methods for the minority classes using adversarial methods and generative models following <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Mayer et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Wei and Zou, 2019)</ref>, and the GPT2 language model <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Radford et al., 2019)</ref>.</p><p>Replace Named Entities (RNE). It replaces a named entity (PER, LOC, ORG, and MISC) in the input sentence. A candidate NE in a sentence is replaced by another one according to a previously collected list of NEs <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Mayer et al., 2020)</ref>. Then, the most similar NE is selected by using pre-trained FastText embeddings <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Bojanowski et al., 2016)</ref>. In our use case, we notice that the number of NEs PER, LOC, and ORG are very few compared to MISC. This might be due to the fact that HS messages in our collection mostly target groups and not individuals. However, expressions like muslims, jews, or blacks are present in the MISC category and replaced, as in Example 8. As it can be noticed, the expression preserves its meaning, that is, the use of the rhetorical question to convey that Muslims are not considered as a part of society.</p><p>8.

It replaces emphasising adverbs like considerably or largely, with another scalar adverb that might increase or decrease the emphasis of an adjective/verb. 9. Original: I do like the outfit they dressed the simian in ; he looks so regal (WSF) Augmented: I do like the outfit they dressed the simian in ; he looks incredibly regal</p><p>Example 9 is another implicit racist HS message that uses irony by combining simian, dressed, and regal. RSA replaces the scalar adverb, slightly increasing the emphasis of regal in the sentence. Add Adverbs to Verbs (AAV). It adds modifiers to verbs to accentuate them. In this case, we use speculative adverbs like certainly, likely, clearly.</p><p>10. Original: I wish we lived in a world in which only men could be doctors, lawyers, firemen, and teachers. (MCONAN) Augmented: I wish we lived in a world in which only men could plausibly be doctors, lawyers, firemen, and teachers.</p><p>In Example 10, the meaning is made elusive by the use of the expression I wish we lived, the addition of plausibly alters the possibility of the verb "to be", but keeps the misogyny meaning.</p><p>Replace Adjectives (RA). Easy Data Augmentation (EDA). Given an input sentence, EDA randomly: i) replaces a non-stop word expression with a synonym using Wordnet; ii) inserts a synonym of a non-stop word in a random position; iii) chooses two words of the sentence and swaps their positions; iv) removes each word in the sentence with a certain probability. Only one of the four operations at a time is applied to a sentence.</p><p>13. Original: A lot of white women are trying to create danger by drawing these other people into our countries .

However, performances decrease on the implicit class when applying data augmentation strategies GM and GM+Revised, and only slightly improve on the subtle class.</p></div>

<div><head n="6">Conclusions</head><p>In this paper, we have presented ISHate, the first benchmark dataset annotated with both implicit and subtle HS labels, which represents a challenging test-bed to evaluate computational approaches. We also provide a fine-grained annotation for implicit HS messages with 18 implicit properties which represent the relevant features that HS classifiers should possess to improve implicit HS detection. It has been created enriching 7 existing datasets for HS detection over different topics and from different social media. We have shown that current SOTA models fail to properly detect implicit and subtle HS messages as peculiar features connected to Sentiment, Inference, Context and Irony, as well as complex syntactic structure, cannot be properly understood. We also investigated data augmentation strategies to increase the number of instances for the minority classes. We show that -while they cannot be the ultimate solution to the lack of implicit and subtle examples -they still play a role in improving the systems' performances, in line with <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">ElSherief et al. (2021)</ref>. As for future work, we plan to propose alternative large-scale methods to collect implicit and subtle messages by targeting "hateful" users, manual creation <ref type="bibr">(Wiegand et al., 2021a</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Wiegand et al., , 2022) )</ref> or refining human-in-the-loop generative methods as in <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Hartvigsen et al., 2022)</ref>. Also, we will investigate features modeling implicit properties <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Wallace et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Troiano et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Frenda and Patti, 2019)</ref> and new model architectures for HS detection <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Nejadgholi et al., 2022)</ref>.</p></div>
<div><head>Limitations</head><p>The main limitation of this paper lies in the intrinsic difficulty to provide a clear definition of the notions of Implicit HS and Subtle HS (given the limited number of definitions available in the literature for these notions), and, as a consequence, to build annotated resources. Enhancing the ISHate dataset with new instances requires future annotators to be experts in computational linguistics trained on our annotation guidelines through pilot annotations to keep the same level of agreement. This restricts crowdsourcing-like options, making the resource building process more expensive. Moreover, the complexity of the messages and of the considered categories makes the process time-consuming (i.e., a trained annotator requires 30sec. for explicit messages and 1.30min. for implicit/subtle messages on average). Even opting for generative and synthetic data augmentation approaches, they still require human-in-the-loop intervention and high computational resources to generate Implicit/Subtle HS messages on a big scale.</p></div>
<div><head>A Performance Details in Data Augmentation</head><p>Inspired by the ranked one augmentation strategy in ElSherief et al. ( <ref type="formula">2021</ref>), i.e., a back-translation approach, we also test SOTA models on our dataset, ISHate, with the augmentation techniques described in Section 4.4. Each model is trained with the originally collected data described in Section 4.3 and additional data obtained from one augmentation strategy. At the end, we also evaluate each model using only non-augmented test data. Tables <ref type="table">6a</ref> and<ref type="table">6b</ref> show the experiments' results on tasks A and B.</p><p>We further analyse the errors committed by the best performing model on task A. We took from Table <ref type="table">6a</ref> <software ContextAttributes="used">HateBERT</software>+ALL and the third annotation layer described in Sections 3 and 4 to identify which are the most frequent implicit properties on task A miss-classified messages.  We also analysed the embeddings of our bestperforming models in tasks A and B (Hate-BERT+ALL and USE+SVM+BT, respectively) through t-SNE (van der <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Maaten and Hinton, 2008)</ref>. Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> show the text embeddings for sentences of the test set, labeled by both classifiers and annotators, for the implicit and subtle tasks.   </p></div>

<div><head>C Annotation Tool Interface</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure">3a</ref> demonstrates a screenshot of the annotation interface of the Label Studio tool used for the labeling process. According to the annotation scheme represented by three annotation layers (discussed in Section 3 and Subsection 4.2) Label Studio has three consecutive annotation steps. The first step consists in implicitness with three choices: Implicit HS, Explicit HS, Undecided, keeping in mind that the tool allows to filter Non-Hate out before starting the labeling process. The first choice of Implicit HS or Explicit HS brings in the appearance of the second step of subtlety with three choices: Subtle, Non-Subtle, Undecided. This step does not appear with an Undecided choice at the previous step. As well as that, the choice of Implicit HS triggers the appearance of the third step which consists of implicit properties being characteristic of only implicit messages. Figure <ref type="figure">3b</ref> shows the shape of the resultant dataset after annotation.</p></div><figure xml:id="fig_0"><head /><label /><figDesc>(a) Embedding using predicted annotations.(b) Embedding using manual annotations.</figDesc></figure>

However, we still consider that effective classifiers for this task are necessary to tackle implicit and subtle online hate on scale and prevent the spreading of this harmful content online. Our work aims at making a step towards that objective and encourages the scientific community to investigate these aspects.    </p></div>			</div>
