<div><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Visual analytics is widely known for facilitating human reasoning through interactive tools embedding visual representations that highlight and reveal the relationships within data. It is a suitable approach to support decision-making processes in application domains as diverse as public health <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, and finance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, where professionals are confronted with the analysis of huge datasets, often characterized by multiple attributes or dimensions. Nonetheless, as the number data dimensions increases, using a single view to display as much information as possible at once might minimize the need for exploration but it can engender cognitive overload on users and create visual clutter-related issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</p><p>The coordinated multiple views (CMVs) paradigm tackles the problem of representing multidimensional data via a predefined set of views <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> that represent different perspectives to the data, while providing coordinating operations between views to support reasoning <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. However, the great variety of available visualization techniques to explore multidimensional datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> makes it unfeasible to determine a single combination of visualization techniques capable of solving every domain-related task. Moreover, most CMV-based systems usually deal with single datasets, being of little help when user reasoning requires comparing different data subsets.</p><p>Typically, in an exploratory context, the user has no defined goal and is looking for no particular outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Though, when finding something interesting, users should be able to retrace their exploratory path to explain how they found the results. Moreover, the validation of hypotheses might require branching out the exploratory path to compare data observed in different views. Evidence of these exploratory processes has promoted rapid growth in research on analytical provenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, including techniques to capture, visualize, and analyze provenance information. Most visualization systems record the user's actions through history graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, which is often not enough to analyze the analytical process <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p><p>Contributions. The primary contribution of this paper is a flexible visualization approach based on the concept of chained views, capable of depicting analytical provenance via a sequence of views, while supporting one or more visualization techniques applied to one or more datasets. Thus, it supports visual analysis via multiple alternative exploration scenarios that can be retraced and modified. We compare our solution with other existing approaches, highlighting the need for innovative and flexible tools for exploring large datasets, and demonstrate the feasibility of the chained views approach through an interactive visual tool called <software>MGExplorer</software>, created to assist the exploration of multivariate networks.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II summarizes related works on multiple and integrated views and analytical provenance visualization. Section III presents <software>MGExplorer</software>, a visualization interface to assist the exploration of multidimensional networks. Section IV demonstrates our approach through a use case employing a coauthorship dataset. Section V presents an evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of <software ContextAttributes="used">MGExplorer</software>. Section VI discusses the contributions of this work and concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div><head>II. RELATED WORK</head><p>Several works in the literature use chained views to explore large, multidimensional datasets due to its ability to provide users with means of (i) choosing the visualization techniques and data subsets meaningful to their analyses, (ii) retracing their path to understand how they arrived at a certain point in the exploration and to identify the starting points of specific exploration paths, and (iii) creating alternative paths from previous points in the exploratory process.</p></div>
<div><head>A. Chained Views to Explore Multidimensional Datasets</head><p>Table <ref type="table">I</ref> summarizes the visualization tools surveyed in this section according to the function of the proposed visualization techniques (e.g., identifying variables' distribution, comparing data items); whether they allow the user to modify the topology of the input data to answer different questions; whether they provide support for an interactive history of visualizations created over the exploration process, allowing the user to explore and view provenance information even when visualizations are not displayed on the screen; and the purpose of authors for using chained views, whether it is meant for analytical provenance studies or a different motivation.</p><p>The <software ContextAttributes="used">ConnectedCharts</software> <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> tool supports instantiating and placing different charts freely on the display area; curves connecting charts show the correspondence between data elements or axes. Although the visualization anchors the curves to the edges of the charts and draws only the curves created by the user to avoid occlusion, it is still overlaid by several lines connecting the multiple geometric shapes in each chart, which could compromise readability. Moreover, the relationships between views are only item-based, while <software ContextAttributes="used">MGExplorer</software> also supports relationships based on subsets of data.</p><p>Domino <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> allows the user to arrange, combine, and manipulate subsets of data, while explicitly representing the relationships between those subsets and allowing the user to choose suitable visualization techniques. However, it uses a juxtaposed layout that restrain the possible exploratory paths by placing views side-by-side and may cause ambiguities by juxtaposing non-semantically related paths.</p><p><software ContextAttributes="used">GraphTrail</software> <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and <software ContextAttributes="used">SOMFlow</software> <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> systems support the exploration of large datasets by using multiple connected views and diverse visualization techniques. <software ContextAttributes="used">GraphTrail</software> supports the exploration of large multivariate, heterogeneous networks through drag-and-drop interactions used to refine subsets of data in a new view while showing users' exploration history by lines connecting the views. In <software ContextAttributes="used">SOMFlow</software>, each view shows a cluster refinement of a dataset and the links represent the analytical workflow of the exploration partition process. Both approaches are restricted to subsets of a unique dataset, while <software ContextAttributes="used">MGExplorer</software> also allows instantiating views using data from external datasets via querying operations.</p><p>It is worthy to notice that, although these four systems allow the user to follow alternative exploratory paths by hiding the current views and instantiating new ones, they fail to provide an alternative visual presentation of provenance information that allow users to compare or recover previous exploratory paths. For that purpose, our approach includes both the visual connection between views and an interactive history panel, displaying and allowing interaction with provenance information during the whole experience.</p></div>
<div><head>B. Provenance Data Visualization</head><p>Analytical provenance focuses on understanding users' reasoning process by studying their interactions while using a visualization system <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In this work, we are interested in visualizing provenance information to allow the users to interact with it to understand their exploratory paths and support further studies of these data to improve user experience. In this section, we discuss provenance visualization according to three aspects of analytic provenance: (i) why to analyze provenance data, (ii) what are the types of provenance data and ways to encode it, and (iii) how to analyze provenance data.</p><p>There are several reasons (why) for provenance analysis, such as understanding users, evaluating systems and algorithms, building adaptive systems, model steering, replicating, verifying and re-analyzing, reporting and storytelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Our work aims to allow users to recreate their analytical reasoning process, while supporting verification, replication, or reapplication of analysis sessions. This could be supported by history trees containing enough metadata to allow the user to search and retrieve visualizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> through features such as the ones provided by <software ContextAttributes="used">VisTrails</software> <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, which allows the user to create, change, and compare visualizations by exploring the graphical representation of the dataflows. The links between visualizations in <software ContextAttributes="used">GraphTrail</software> <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and <software ContextAttributes="used">SOMFlow</software> <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> represent the workflow, allowing users to understand the actions performed from a visualization or analytical step to another.</p><p>The second aspect (what) refers to the way provenance data is represented. Among the schemes of provenance data representation (e.g., grammars, models, graphs), the sequencebased scheme is the most common <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and represents the user's interactions as a list of actions. Graphs are used to connect entities (or concepts) that change state during the exploration process, or temporal events, as in history graphs (e.g., <software ContextAttributes="used">VisTrails</software>, <software ContextAttributes="used">GraphTrail</software>, and <software ContextAttributes="used">SOMFlow</software>). Further to allowing the user to go back and forth in the exploration path, graph encoding can, for instance, allow a user to interact directly with the history (provenance) graph to generate a story of the user's analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. <software ContextAttributes="used">MGExplorer</software> is based on a history graph, which allows forking alternative exploratory paths or changes in parameters of a previously created view; all the views created by users during an exploratory process can be shown or hidden and used to record their flow.</p><p>Finally, as for the how aspect, previous works have addressed provenance analysis using methods such as classification and statistical modeling techniques, pattern analysis, probabilistic techniques for prediction, grammar and scripts analysis, and interactive visual analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Although this paper do not target the analysis of provenance data, the explicit representation of provenance information supported by our approach allows anyone to perform an interactive visual analysis on the exploratory flows by querying the parameters used in each step of the process.</p></div>
<div><head>III. MGEXPLORER A. Design rationale</head><p>Exploring large datasets through multiple views systems can lead to multiple exploratory paths with arbitrary starting points. Thus, to assess users' reasoning during the exploration process, one should be able to retrace the dependency between the views. For that, we developed <software>MGExplorer</software> (Multidimensional Graph Explorer), a visualization tool to assist the exploration of multidimensional network data. The tool uses the chained views approach to allows users to combine multiple visualization techniques during the exploration process while recording descriptive information of the exploration path, thus supporting analytical provenance studies.</p><p>Mainly, <software ContextAttributes="used">MGExplorer</software> provides visualization techniques that support graph data exploration by revealing different types of relationships within the dataset (e.g., network, clusters, pairwise, and order). The tool can encode different data dimensions by modifying the graph topology. To avoid cluttering problems, the visualization layout (i.e., the arrangement of views) is flexible, allowing users to freely position the views, hide and show views of interest without losing the connections between them. It also supports interaction with the history of analytical actions performed during the exploration of the dataset. Furthermore, to ensure accessibility, <software ContextAttributes="used">MGExplorer</software> is based on web technologies, i.e., JavaScript, which D<software ContextAttributes="used">3 (Data-Driven Documents)</software> library is particularly used in frontends, and the <software ContextAttributes="used">nodejs</software> library manages the access to SPARQL endpoints, facilitating the retrieval of different datasets for exploration <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> . The framework is generic enough to support the exploration of data from different sources (e.g., linked data <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, web services, and databases), as it includes in the server side a data transformation process that adapts the input dataset to the system's input format. Thus, data visualization through <software ContextAttributes="used">MGExplorer</software> comprises mainly two complex processes: (1) data treatment and (2) data exploration.</p></div>
<div><head>B. Overview of the Exploratory Process</head><p>We use <software ContextAttributes="used">MGExplorer</software> to explore a dataset describing a coauthorship network, i.e., a graph where authors are explicitly related due to the publications they have together. The data exploration process unfolds into two phases (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>): (1) the overview phase, which is based on visualizing the network through a node-edge diagram. This visualization allows the user to understand the co-authorship clusters within the data; and (2) the exploratory phase, which enables users to select items of interest in the node-edge diagram, subsetting the data to explore it through different, complementary visualization techniques. This way, the generic aspect of the <software ContextAttributes="used">MGExplorer</software> framework enables the combination of multiple visualizations to allow both the comparison of two or more different subsets of data through a particular perspective generated by a particular visualization and the comparison of multiple representations of the same subset of data using multiple, complementary visualization techniques. </p></div>
<div><head>C. Visualization Techniques</head><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">II</ref> presents the set of five visualization techniques currently available in <software ContextAttributes="used">MGExplorer</software> to support data exploration.</p><p>The <software ContextAttributes="used">NodeEdge</software> diagram shows nodes as items and edges between them as relationships. It provides an overview of any network defined within the dataset according to different criteria (e.g., keywords, co-publications, etc.). The <software ContextAttributes="used">ClusterVis</software> <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> technique depicts clusters according to some relationship among data items. It has a multi-ring layout, where the innermost ring is formed by the data items (represented by circles), and the remaining rings display the data attributes (represented by rectangles). The items belonging to the same cluster are connected via curved lines.</p><p>The IRIS technique allows isolating a data item of interest (at the center) and showing the remaining data items with which it has a relationship in a circular view <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. The data attributes of such pairwise relationships are encoded by the height and color of a bar placed between the item of interest and each related item. Upon clicking on an item, it is placed on the field of view, switching the IRIS' focus.</p><p>The <software ContextAttributes="used">GlyphMatrix</software> <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> technique is based on a matrix where rows and columns represent data items in a cluster, and the cells contain glyphs encoding attributes that describe a pairwise relationship. The default glyph is a star-plot-like shape, with a variable number of axes used to encode values of selected data attributes. Hovering over a glyph in the matrix enlarges it, allowing to see the data attributes' details.</p><p>The Bar Chart technique shows the distribution of data attributes' value for an item or set of items. In our case study, the x-axis encodes temporal information, while the y-axis encodes the counting of co-publications. The data is displayed as a single bar per time period or multiple colored bars to represent categorical information of attributes. Each view is a self-contained element, which includes a visualization technique and supports subsetting operations to allow further exploration of subsets of data through different views. The views can be dragged, allowing the user to rearrange the visualization space in meaningful ways to the ongoing analysis. They are connected via line segments, which reveal their dependencies and enable tracing back the exploration path, thus preserving provenance information.</p><p><software ContextAttributes="used">MGExplorer</software> starts displaying an overview of the data through the <software ContextAttributes="used">NodeEdge</software> visualization and a History panel (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1-C</ref>), which displays the exploration path in a hierarchical format to indicate the dependencies between views and supports quick recovery of the multiple analytical paths that emerge from a particular view. These views are displayed throughout the whole exploration process. Recalling that in an exploratory visualization, the user would inspect the dataset without any particular goal or expected outcome, the History panel is interactive, enabling the user to revisit any of the previous visualizations and hide any of the currently displayed views. This way, the user can clean the visualization space while focusing on what is relevant to the ongoing analysis.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> illustrates how <software ContextAttributes="used">MGExplorer</software> supports the visualization of different perspectives to the dataset by modifying the graph topology. For the sake of simplicity we use only three views with the <software ContextAttributes="used">NodeEdge</software> visualization to represent a dataset describing co-authorship information, where nodes represent: a) co-authors, b) co-authors, with color encoding authors' affiliation(s), and c) keywords used in the publications.</p></div>
<div><head>IV. USE CASE</head><p>In this use case, we demonstrate the usage of <software ContextAttributes="used">MGExplorer</software>'s visual and interactive tools to explore a co-authorship dataset extracted from the HAL (open-access repository) SPARQL Endpoint<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> through a query that retrieved every publication coauthored by at least one member of a given research organization between the years of 2015 and 2020. The query's results (2,603 RDF<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> triples describing different publications) went through a data transformation process to extract the clusters of co-authors and the descriptive information of their publications (e.g., publication year, type, etc.). The resulting graph contains 497 nodes (authors) and 2,080 edges (connections between authors). In particular, we describe the exploratory process for solving the following analytical task: "determine the impact of recurrent co-authorship to the total number of publications of a particular author".</p><p>There are mainly two indicators in the system that allow measuring the impact of recurrent co-authorship: (i) the number of co-publications and (ii) their distribution over time. For the sake of simplicity, our author of interest will be the one with the most co-authors within the dataset. To solve the task, we need to split it into smaller tasks:</p><p>1) to determine the author with the highest number of coauthors (author A); 2) to determine their most recurrent co-author (author B), i.e., the one with author A has the most co-publications; and 3) to compare the number of co-publications between authors A and B with the total number of publications co-authored by author A. We begin the exploration by searching for the largest subgraph in the <software ContextAttributes="used">NodeEdge</software> view, which represents the author with the most connections. We can quickly spot two large sub-graphs connecting to the author Franck Michel (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>), who is the author with most co-authors in this dataset. Thus, we continue the analysis with this author as our object of interest, i.e., author A. From this point, the different available visualizations support alternative scenarios to perform the task. Although the temporal distribution of co-publications can only be explored trough the Bar chart technique, identifying the most recurrent co-author can be done through any of the remaining visualizations, resulting on at least three different exploration scenarios. Therefore, we will demonstrate the versatility of our approach by performing this analytical task through two different scenarios, described hereafter. </p></div>
<div><head>A. Scenario 1</head><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref> shows the exploration path of this scenario. To determine the author with whom author A has the most publications, we choose the IRIS visualization technique (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3a</ref>), which we launch by right-clicking on the node representing author A and then selecting the technique on the context menu. In the IRIS view, we search for the longest bar, which length encodes the number of co-publications between two authors. Upon clicking on the bar, the system centers it in the IRIS view, allowing us to inspect the data. We observe that Catherine Faron Zucker is author A's most recurrent co-author, whom we refer to as author B. To compare the number and distribution of their co-publications, we choose the Bar chart technique representing the temporal distribution of publications co-authored by authors A and B (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3b</ref>). We display it by right-clicking on the colored bar between the authors' names in the IRIS and then selecting the Bar chart on the context menu. Then, we revisit the <software ContextAttributes="created">NodeEdge</software> view. There, we trigger the context menu on the node representing author A and select the Bar chart technique, which shows the temporal distribution of publications co-authored by author A (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3c</ref>). Using the information displayed on the views' titles, we observe that author A has co-authored twentynine publications, of which author B co-authored twenty-five. This information allows us to infer that the co-authorship between authors A and B greatly impacts the total number of publications co-authored by author A. Further, we could inspect both Bar charts to identify the importance of the collaboration over the years: the differences in the number of publications are visible in 2015, 2017, and 2020. </p></div>
<div><head>B. Scenario 2</head><p>In this scenario, we determine author A's most recurrent co-author using the <software ContextAttributes="created">GlyphMatrix</software> technique (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4-A</ref>), which we launched from the <software ContextAttributes="created">NodeEdge</software> view through the context menu associated with the node representing author A. To ease the searching process, we sort the authors in the matrix in descending order of the number of co-publications, which is done by modifying the view settings on the panel available at the top-left corner of the view. This way, we know that the cell at the leftmost upper corner provides co-publication information between author A and its most recurrent co-author, Catherine Faron Zucker, hereafter called author B. Thus, we hover over the cell to inspect the glyph, which gives us the number of co-publications per category (7 articles in journals, 17 conference papers, and one article in proceedings). To compare this information with the total number of author A's co-publications, we launch the Bar chart technique via the context menu that we trigger right-clicking on the author's name displayed on the rows of the matrix. The Bar chart (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4-B</ref>) shows the temporal distribution of author A's 29 co-publications per category. We can infer the importance of author B's co-authorship via the only four publications authored by author A that are not co-authored by author B.</p></div>
<div><head>V. EVALUATION</head><p>This section presents a preliminary evaluation of <software ContextAttributes="created">MGExplorer</software> using objective metrics allowing a fair comparison of alternative exploration paths, i.e., the exploratory scenarios for finding co-authors information described in Section III. We compare those with the exploratory scenario required to find co-authorship information on the Web site HAL <ref type="foot" target="#foot_3">4</ref> , which gives a list of publications and authors. This web site is the primary source of data used by <software ContextAttributes="created">MGExplorer</software> and the only alternative for accessing that particular dataset.</p></div>
<div><head>A. Methods and Metrics</head><p>We use the Keystroke-Level Model GOMS (KLM-GOMS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> analysis to simulate the effectiveness and efficiency of <software ContextAttributes="created">MGExplorer</software> by estimating the average time (errorfree) an expert user would take to solve the given task. To perform the analysis, we decompose the exploration flow in atomic actions such as cognitive (e.g., making a choice) and motor tasks (e.g., typing a word). We use the notation and temporal estimation of actions (for an average typist) proposed by Card et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, in which: K refers to pressing a key or a button (ETA: 0.2s); P refers to pointing with the mouse to a target on the display (ETA: 1.1s); M refers to mentally preparing for a task (ETA: 1.35s); and H corresponds to homing the hand on the mouse (ETA: 0.4s).</p></div>
<div><head>B. Results</head><p>Tables III and IV present the atomic actions that compose each exploration scenario. Scenario 1 contains 27 atomic actions (8 clicks, 9 pointing, and 10 mental operations), which would take an expert user 25 seconds to complete. Scenario 2 contains 34 atomic actions (9 clicks, 12 pointing, and 13 mental operations), resulting in an estimated completion time of 32.55 seconds. This time difference could be explained by the adopted strategy to identify author A's most recurrent coauthor in the <software>GlyphMatrix</software>, which required 9 extra pointing and clicking actions in a settings panel to sort the authors in a way that would ease the visual search within the matrix.</p><p>The HAL interface does not provide the users with counting authors' publications or co-authors, which means that they must calculate it by themselves. We estimate that the task would take at least 274 atomic actions (114 mental operations, 54 clicks, 54 pointing, and 52 homing actions). The interface allows filtering authors by name using a list of interactive alphabet letters. Upon selecting a letter, the system shows a list of authors whose names start with that letter. The user must then search for the author of interest within each list and click on it to explore their publications, co-authorship, and other related information. To identify the author with the most coauthors (author A), the user must visit every author's page and count their co-authors; these numbers must be compared to obtain the one with the most co-authors. The interface does </p></div>

Discussion</head><p>The evaluation we performed allowed us to analyze the mental, physical, and temporal demands required from a user while using the <software>MGExplorer</software> tool. For the sake of simplicity, these demands are defined as follows: the mental demand refers to the amount of information one needs to have before the exploration and the information they must remember while exploring the data; the physical demand refers to the amount of physical interaction (e.g., pressing buttons or keys, moving the cursor from one point to another, etc.) necessary to accomplish the task; and the temporal demand refers to the time one has to dedicate into accomplishing the task.</p><p>Since the visualization interface displays every necessary piece of information either directly via colors, symbols, or text, or indirectly via interaction techniques, such as hovering over symbols to get data details on a tooltip, an expert user of the tool should be able to perform a particular analytical task with little mental effort.</p><p>While it is possible to explore co-authorship information using traditional listing interfaces, the user must compute a larger amount of information to obtain the same outcomes as using <software ContextAttributes="created">MGExplorer</software>. Our temporal estimations showed that <software ContextAttributes="created">MGExplorer</software> is very efficient to perform the selected task, requiring around 30 seconds of work, while one of the most straightforward exploration scenarios using the HAL interface is almost eight times slower. These high temporal and mental demands naturally increase the number of atomic actions and therefore the physical demand for performing the task in the HAL interface. Moreover, when using the visualization interface, the users can keep their hands on the mouse the whole time, reducing the need for homing actions, which are highly required when using the HAL interface, if we consider that the user would write down on a piece of paper (or type in a document) the counts of co-authors for further comparison. When analyzing <software ContextAttributes="created">MGExplorer</software> in the context of related works, we find Graph Trail <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> as the closest approach to ours because it allows the user to instantiate views through visual querying, although the interaction for doing that is different. It also represents the dependency between the views that display subsets of the dataset, thus providing provenance information. However, <software ContextAttributes="created">GraphTrail</software> only supports querying on the original dataset to create new views and does not allow the user to hide or show the views created throughout the process, causing the visualization space to be quickly cluttered. This makes it difficult for the user to investigate alternative paths from a previous point in the exploratory history.</p></div>
<div><head>VI. CONCLUSIONS</head><p>In this paper, we presented <software>MGExplorer</software>, a visualization tool to assist the exploration of multidimensional networks using a chained views approach. Its effectiveness and efficiency were demonstrated through an assessment of co-authorship data exploration compared to a traditional interface. <software ContextAttributes="created">MGExplorer</software> development is based on open-source libraries with a generic structure that provides a customizable layout by allowing the expansion of the visualization and interaction techniques palettes, benefiting both designers and users. Designers have a generic system that supports multiple visualizations while users can choose the ones suitable for their analysis.</p><p>The architecture of <software>MGExplorer</software> supports data from different sources and the exploration of data attributes of multidimensional networks from different application areas. It shows a data processing phase that detects the relationships between the dataset items and their attributes before visualization. Furthermore, a server supports the querying of multiple SPARQL endpoints, which allows the retrieval of data from different datasets for use in a view. Thus, the user can explore new hypotheses on the data and bring new data to the process to expand and improve the ongoing analysis.</p><p>The two exploration scenarios demonstrate that <software>MGExplorer</software> supports analytical tasks. Also, they demonstrate that an analytical goal can be achieved through different exploratory paths. Moreover, <software ContextAttributes="created">MGExplorer</software> shows the analytical provenance in these exploratory paths. For our evaluation purposes, we did not consider the time for learning how to use the tools (either <software ContextAttributes="created">MGExplorer</software> or the website HAL). Moreover, we do not take into account variations of strategies that real users might develop to find information using chained views.</p><p>Although the exploration scenarios and our evaluation of the tool based on estimated completion time may be enough to support the claims about the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach compared to traditional interfaces, user-based evaluations are essential and should be performed to determine the usability and suitability of the <software>MGExplorer</software> interface. Future work includes developing user-based evaluations to investigate the usability of <software ContextAttributes="created">MGExplorer</software> for exploring different multidimensional networks and its suitability for exploring coauthorship network data and assisting domain-related tasks.</p><p>The provenance information recorded by the <software>MGExplorer</software> is limited to the subsets of data and the visualizations used during the analysis. Thus, we intend to increase the variety of provenance information by recording, for example, atomic actions relevant to the reasoning and annotations made by users. Future work also includes the analysis of the resulting provenance data, e.g., to identify the most common usages of the system (standard choices of visualizations and instantiating order) according to different types of tasks, which could be used to introduce the system to new users, suggest some wellknown analysis workflows, and to improve overall user experience. Furthermore, we could validate these usage patterns through user-based evaluations involving experts in different application domains. For example, the system could suggest different analysis workflows to perform particular tasks, and the users would evaluate whether and at which level that workflow responds to their needs and how to improve it.</p></div><figure xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.

<div><p>not provide information on the actual number of authors under each alphabet letter, but we do know that there is at least one author for each letter, which means that the user has at least 26 authors to compare. Thus, for the sake of simplicity, we estimate the completion time of this task assuming that the user must perform 26 comparisons. Once author A has been identified, the user would revisit this author's page using the same filtering strategy, where they would compare the co-publications among their co-authors to identify the most recurrent one (author B) and the number of publications they have together (that information can be found next to coauthors' names). On author A's page, the user can also retrieve author A's total number of co-publications; this information is then compared to the number of co-publications with author B to determine the impact of this co-authorship on the total number of publications co-authored by author A. Due to the difficulty of identifying the author with the most co-authors, a process consisting of at least 26 loops taking around 10.1 seconds each, this scenario would take about 278.7 seconds (4.6 minutes) in total to be performed.</p></div>			</div>
