<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In many applications, selfish, dishonest or malicious agents may find an interest in manipulating others. While many works deal with designing robust systems or designing manipulative strategies, few works are interested in defining in a broad sense what is a manipulation and how we can reason with such a notion. In this article, based on a social science literature, we give at first a general definition of manipulation that can be applied in multi-agent systems. A manipulation is a deliberate effect of an agent (called a manipulator ) to instrumentalize another agent (called a victim), while making sure to conceal that effect. Secondly, we show how this definition is related with different fields in computer science where the concept of manipulation is studied. Finally, we present a logical framework, called KBE, to express and reason about manipulations. Since manipulation relies on deliberate effects, KBE introduces a deliberate BIAT operator which abstracts deliberate consequences of actions. We prove that this logic is sound and complete and, we formally define manipulation. Furthermore, based on KBE, we express related notions such as coercion, persuasion, or deception and we show that these notions are different from manipulation.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>In many applications, selfish, dishonest or malicious agents may find an interest in manipulating others. In computer science and social science, manipulation is viewed as controlling or influencing somebody or something, often in a dishonest way so that they do not realize it. For example, reputation systems evaluate the trust that one agent should place in another depending on other agent's testimonies <ref type="bibr">(Hoffman, Zage, &amp; Nita-Rotaru, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Josang &amp; Golbeck, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Ruan &amp; Durresi, 2016)</ref>. However, agents may have interest in those systems in lying so as to mislead others, and push them to interact with some specific agents. Such behaviour is a manipulation in the sense that, to be effective, the liar must ensure that the other agents are unaware he intended to mislead them.</p><p>In the field of artificial intelligence, many works dealt with manipulation as in computational social choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gibbard, 1973;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Parkes &amp; Ungar, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Robinson, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Sanghvi &amp; Parkes, 2004)</ref>, game theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ettinger &amp; Jehiel, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">Wagner &amp; Arkin, 2009)</ref>, or recommendation systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Mobasher, Burke, Bhaumik, &amp; Sandvig, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Resnick &amp; Sami, 2008)</ref>. From a general perspective, there are many works on concepts closely related to manipulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Masters, Smith, Sonenberg, &amp; Kirley, 2021)</ref>. For instance, in modal logic literature, some works have modeled social influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Lorini &amp; Sartor, 2016)</ref> and deception <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Sakama, Caminada, &amp; Herzig, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">Van Ditmarsch, Van Eijck, Sietsma, &amp; Wang, 2012)</ref>. Interestingly, social science deals with manipulation as a combination of many concepts, e.g. strategies, deception, obfuscation, intentionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Akopova, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cohen, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Handelman, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Todd, 2013)</ref>. A review of social science literature allows us to consider a general definition of manipulation, i.e. acting in such a way to produce a deliberate effect of influencing another agent while concealing this influence.</p><p>This article is an extended version of our previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Leturc &amp; Bonnet, 2020)</ref>. In this work, we defined a modal logic that allows one to reason about this concept of manipulation. To this end and to express deliberate effects, we have proposed a deliberate BIAT modality and combined it with a STIT-like modality to catch all consequences of actions and side-effects of actions. Concealment was expressed through epistemic and doxastic modalities. In the present article, we extend this previous work with two new contributions: (1) we provide a broad state-of-the-art about manipulation in social science, and about logical systems to express such notion; (2) we provide the complete proofs of all theorems given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Leturc and Bonnet (2020)</ref>.</p><p>The remainder of this article is structured as follows. In Section 2, we present a review of the notion of manipulation drawn from social science literature, and we propose a general definition of manipulation. In Section 3, in view of the previous definition of manipulation, we survey available logical tools that are able to express it. In Section 4, we propose a logical framework and show that it is sound and complete. In Section 5, we formally define manipulation, and show our formal framework can also be used to model coercion, persuasion and deception. Finally, in Section 6 we instantiate an example.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Defining manipulation</head><p>The notion of manipulation is present in several fields of computer science such as in social choice theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gibbard, 1973)</ref>, or in reputation systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">(Vallée &amp; Bonnet, 2015)</ref> where it is defined as a strategy allowing an agent to influence and control the individual (or collective) decision-making process of a group of agents using false information in order to push the latter to make a decision in favour of the manipulating agent. However, this is a restrictive notion of manipulation, as shown by works on social psychology, manipulative agent does not necessarily use the transmission of false information to manipulate. For example, the "foot in the door" consists in getting the victim to engage in a preparatory behavior to facilitate a decision in favor of the manipulator <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Joule, Beauvois, &amp; Deschamps, 2002)</ref>. As another example, social proof consists in showing a victimized agent a set of behaviours that other agents exhibit in order to influence him or her to imitate those agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Cialdini, 2012)</ref>. All those manners -using false informations, behaviors or social proof -are different concrete strategies to manipulate. In order to model manipulation in a broader way, we need a sufficiently broad definition of manipulation and we propose to extract it through social science literature. For this reason, Section 2.1 presents a survey on manipulation from the point of view of these fields. This state-of-the-art then allows us to give a definition of the term in Section 2.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Manipulation in social science</head><p>Social scientists often disagree on the definition of manipulation. For some of them, manipulation is considered to be the act of altering the judgment of individuals by depriving them of some of their deliberate choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kligman &amp; Culver, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Saint Clair, 1966;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Sunstein, 2015)</ref>. However as stated by <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Handelman, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Rudinow, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Sorlin, 2017)</ref>, such a definition would lead to consider rational persuasion, deception or coercion as manipulation whereas most people would distinguish them. Consequently, there are four ways to consider manipulation in social science literature: considering it as a "vague concept", as strategies to alter the others' judgment, as an exercise of power over others, and finally as the invisible exercise of power. We review each of these points-of-view and extract their main features to propose a definition of manipulation for modeling.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.1.">Manipulation seen as a vague concept</head><p>By reviewing several situations in which the term "manipulation" is frequently used but giving counterexamples to each of them, the philosopher Felicia Nimue Ackerman claims that it is impossible to characterize manipulation because it is a "combinatorially vague concept" <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ackerman, 1995)</ref>. By "combinatorially vague concept", she means that there are a variety of conditions under which the term is frequently used but none of them are sufficient to discriminate with certainty between manipulative and non-manipulative situations. To support her claim, Ackerman made a broad review of those conditions, including for instance use of indirect, cunning and subtle means, falsification or omission of information, deception, pressure and unethical behaviors, presence of hidden motives, and so on. While Ackerman claims that we cannot know what combinations of these conditions actually constitute manipulation. We reject this point-of-view for at least two reasons: (1) considering manipulation as a vague concept makes impossible to give an explicit formal definition of manipulation and reasoning with it as proposed in this paper and, (2) it would mean that efforts to model manipulation are doomed to failure unless to consider machine learning techniques to classify the data space into categories such as "manipulation" or "not manipulation", which is currently not the aim of this paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.2.">Manipulation seen as strategies to tamper the others' judgment</head><p>For many social scientists, manipulation is characterized by the use of psychological methods that can alter the victim's judgement, making him vulnerable to the manipulator's influence and unable to perceive the manipulation. For this reason, manipulation can be defined as strategies to exploit the others' weaknesses: manipulation is any successful and intentional act of influencing an agent's beliefs or behavior, directly or indirectly, by causing changes in mental processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Baron, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Faden &amp; Beauchamp, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kahneman, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Mills, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Rudinow, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">Wilkinson, 2013)</ref>. Those changes can be:</p><p>(1) increasing or decreasing the available options to the victim;</p><p>(2) offering a reward or threatening punishment to the victim;</p><p>(3) directly influencing the victim's mental states. This point-of-view focuses on the strategies behind a manipulation. Obviously, in the literature there exists many definitions of strategy and the reader may refer to Mintzberg's review <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Mintzberg, 1987)</ref>. A manipulation can be based on exploiting</p></div>

A taxonomy of manipulation strategies in social science an agent weakness as a cognitive dissonance, deflecting norms as social commitment, abusing trust as betrayal, playing on the rational behavior of the victim, relying on emotions such as playing on fear with coercion, or a manipulation strategy can be based on knowledge or beliefs as lying, or bullshitting. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> sums up and gives examples of those kind of manipulation strategies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Exploiting agent weaknesses</head><p>The theory of free will compliance, introduced in social psychology by <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Joule et al. (2002)</ref>, describes a set of behavioral manipulation techniques. Among them, baiting involves asking a victim for a simple service, such as asking the time. It turns out that after obtaining this first service, it is easier to ask for a more compelling service. Thus, a manipulator may have the deliberate intention to use one of these techniques to manipulate humans. Another kind of weakness are cognitive biases <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Kahneman, 2011)</ref>. An agent can exploit those cognitive bias in order to induce another agent to make commitments of which he is unable to see the importance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Deflecting norms</head><p>A manipulator can deflect a social norm to his own benefit. In social psychology, presents a set of norms on which a manipulator can rely to push another agent to realize his desire. For example, the norm of reciprocity is an internalized norm that says to always reciprocate with agents who offer us a service. Thus, a manipulator may circumvent this norm by voluntarily offering a costless service or resource to a victim to push him to provide a costier service requested in return by the manipulator <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cialdini, 2001)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Abusing trust</head><p>According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Castelfranchi and Falcone (2010)</ref>, trust is the backbone of society. It is also a tool of manipulation. Indeed, a manipulation strategy consists in building trust in order to better control the other agents of the system. In marketing, trust is a tool to get a customer to buy a product he does not need and without his awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Calo, 2013)</ref>. For example, salespeople can announce a "scarcity" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Cialdini, 2001)</ref> to give a customer the illusion that a product is of quality because there is not much left in stock.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Using rationality</head><p>Rationality is a behaviour of agents who always want to maximize what they can hope to gain from a given situation. It can be used to influence decisions without the agent even being aware of this influence. Governments can use rationality as an argument to undermine political opponents. For instance, the 2003 Iraq war was presented as "rational warfare" to gain support <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Handelman, 2009)</ref>. Other examples of manipulations that can circumvent or subvert the victim's rational abilities are the use of nudges, or small discreet rewards to push an agent in the "good" direction <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Wilkinson, 2013)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Relying on emotions</head><p>Manipulations between humans can have an emotional basis. A manipulative agent simulates certain emotional states, for example when a child cries to get a new toy from his parents. The child deliberately puts himself in this state to affect the parents' emotional state in order to get what he wants. In psychiatry, this emotionally based manipulation strategy is found in many examples such as when a person threatens to commit suicide. In this case, the threat aims at getting something from the others: a listening ear, a service, hoping to get back together with a person <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gunderson, 1984)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Playing on knowledge and beliefs</head><p>The linguist Eddo Rigotti presents a typology of the main processes that allow a manipulating agent to mislead another agent by playing on his beliefs and knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Rigotti, 2005)</ref>. For example, sophistry is a technique that consists in pushing another agent to deduce something false in order to exploit this error. Another example consists in hiding the truth of a proposition which could weaken or contradict the manipulator's discourse <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Maillat &amp; Oswald, 2009)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.3.">Manipulation seen as the exercise of power over others</head><p>Beyond the strategies an agent can use to manipulate, for many researchers, manipulation is primarily characterized as a form of power exercised over others <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abell, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Goodin, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kligman &amp; Culver, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Maoz, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Todd, 2013)</ref>.</p><p>Manipulation is not simply a loss of autonomy. While manipulation is sometimes characterized as a loss of autonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Poulin, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Raz, 1986</ref>) (e.g. when a parasite takes control of its host), the philospher Patrick Todd claims it is not enough to define manipulation because it is necessary to distinguish between manipulation as the manipulation of an object, and manipulation as a case in which agents act in a manipulative manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(Todd, 2013)</ref>. However, loss of autonomy is necessary for the manipulation to take place.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Manipulation is a deliberate intention.</head><p>Many social scientists state that manipulation is primarily an intention to act on another agent with influence. This influence is said to be manipulative if it is deliberately and intentionally used by the manipulator while the influence is said to be not manipulative as long as it is sincere, i.e. in accordance with what the influencer takes to be true, relevant, and appropriate <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kligman &amp; Culver, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Noggle, 1996)</ref>. Indeed, when an agent manipulates another, the act is knowingly deliberate. As social science rejects the concept of unintentional manipulation, using a mechanism of influence without knowing it, and therefore without having intended it, cannot be considered as a manipulation.</p><p>Manipulation is the intention to change something. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kligman and Culver (1992)</ref> define manipulation as the manpilator's intention to change something in his environment. For example, a manipulator may deliberately withhold or selectively present certain information and omit others, exploiting the ignorance or beliefs of his victim in order to maintain control over his perceived options and direct him in the direction desired by the manipulator. For <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Maoz (1990)</ref>, political manipulation is an attempt by one or more individuals to structure a collective decision as to maximize (resp. minimize) the chances of a favourable (resp. unfavourable) outcome. For <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Abell (1977)</ref>, manipulation is a process where a manipulative agent A control a manipulated agent B's preferences by reducing B's understanding of the situation or B's means of action. Interestingly, all those definitions are similar to those used in game theory and social choice theory. For example, manipulating a voting system consists in providing a false preference profile to ensure a result preferred to the one normally obtained with the true preference profile <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Gärdenfors, 1976;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Gibbard, 1973)</ref>.</p><p>Manipulation does not always go against the interests of the others. When one agent manipulates the other, he is doing it for his own interest, and this often goes against the interests of the others. That is why <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Goodin (1980)</ref> claims that manipulation is primarily a deceptive influence compelling one to act against one's will. In the same way, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Barnhill (2014)</ref> states manipulation is also the intention of influencing certain traits or psychological dispositions in order to bring the victim into ideals of beliefs, desires or emotions in a way that is generally not in the victim's self-interest in the current context. However, all manipulations do not go against the self-interest of the manipulated agent. For example, the placebo effect that is sometimes used in medicine to make a patient believe that he will be cured with an ineffective drug is a manipulation in the patient's interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">(Turner, Deyo, Loeser, Von Korff, &amp; Fordyce, 1994)</ref>. That is why some authors consider the existence of benevolent manipulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Rosenberg &amp; Pearlin, 1962)</ref> meaning somebody exhibits a manipulative behavior in order to push someone else to do something in the latter's interest. Obviously, it means that the manipulator has a representation (possibly impropered) of the "victim"'s interest.</p><p>Manipulation is an instrumentalization of the others. Being benevolant or not, manipulation can be viewed in all cases as a psychosocial maneuver that uses aggression, coercion, intelligence, deception and trickery to influence someone in order to achieve a manipulator's desire <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Bowers, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Rigotti, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Saint Clair, 1966)</ref>. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Rigotti (2005)</ref> said the victim of a manipulation pursues the aim of the manipulator in the illusion of pursuing his or her own goal. While Saint Clair <ref type="bibr">(1966)</ref> states that there must be an incompatibility between the manipulator's desires and the manipulated's ones, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Bowers (2003)</ref> claims that manipulation seeks to achieve a desired goal without regard to the interests or needs of the manipulated agent. In both cases, achieving the manipulator's desires is the fundamental point associated with manipulation. That is why social science considers the manipulation as a form of intrumentalization, namely using somebody as a mean to achieve a goal.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.4.">Manipulation seen as the invisible exercise of a power</head><p>Interestingly, many researchers states manipulation is primarily an hidden influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(de Saussure &amp; Schulz, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Handelman, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Van Dijk, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">Ware, 1981)</ref>.</p><p>For instance in clinical settings, manipulation is then associated with a patient's efforts (e.g. somatic complaints, provocative actions or misleading messages, and selfdestructive acts) to use covert means to gain control or support from significant persons <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Gunderson, 1984)</ref>. In linguistics, manipulation is a malevolant intention of the speaker with a character of hidden influence <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Akopova, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Rigotti, 2005)</ref>: a manipulation is carried out when the addressee can no longer see the speaker's intentions behind what he or she is asserting. More generally, <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Handelman (2009)</ref> states the practical meaning of the manipulation is that the target is subject to a hidden influence and believes that his or her choices are made freely and independently. The manipulation is therefore intended to motivate the target to operate in a form that, under normal conditions, would likely cause him or her to resist or reject the interaction. That is why this influence must be above all indirect, invisible and secret in order to take place. While this secrecy can simply mean the victim cannot use his deliberative capabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">(Sunstein, 2015)</ref> to know or understand what is happening <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Ware, 1981)</ref>, awareness is also considered: manipulation can be viewed as a form of control in which the manipulated is not aware of what is happening or of the manipulator's strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(de Saussure &amp; Schulz, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Van Dijk, 2006)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Towards a general definition of manipulation</head><p>However, although we have highlighted significant differences among researchers, it appears that there is agreement among them on certain points. Hence, we use these commonalities to consider a general definition of manipulation. One of the main characteristics of manipulation is that it is, on the one hand, the exercise of power over others, and on the other hand, the exercise of a concealed power from the manipulated agents.</p><p>Firstly, manipulation is a power which is distinct from the more general concept of influence. While influence may be exerted in an unintentional way, manipulation is first and foremost a voluntary effect of a manipulator to use the victim to accomplish something <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Akopova, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cohen, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Handelman, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Todd, 2013)</ref>. Manipulation is necessarily intentional, and the use of the concept of "unintentional manipulation" is strongly rejected <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Kligman &amp; Culver, 1992)</ref>. Indeed, we cannot call it manipulation if the so-called manipulator did not deliberate about manipulating a victim. Thus, an agent who unwittingly influences another agent without his knowledge cannot be manipulating. That is why we consider in the sequel manipulation as an instrumentalization of a victim. Unlike influence, which can relate to beliefs, knowledge or even intentions, instrumentalization is a deliberate influence on the effects produced by a victim whether those latters are deliberate or not.</p><p>Secondly, this instrumentalization is concealed from the victim. Manipulation cannot simply be reduced to coercion and persuasion <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Handelman, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kligman &amp; Culver, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Sorlin, 2017)</ref> as it is something that happens completely invisibly, and by the time we start talking about manipulation, the act has already been committed. So, when we talk about manipulation, whether it is in the past tense or the second person, we are definitely stating something that the victim did not know. So the inevitable conclusion is that the target is necessarily unable to identify that he was subjected to a manipulative influence. The linguist Sandrine Sorlin claims that if one can say "he tried to manipulate me but failed", we cannot say "he manipulated me but failed" <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">(Sorlin, 2017)</ref>. He insists on the fact that success is embedded in manipulation. Manipulation implies the success of this enterprise. Finally, manipulation is not similar to deception <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Handelman, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kligman &amp; Culver, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Sorlin, 2017)</ref>. Indeed, deception may be related to lying which can be one possible strategy to manipulate a victim. However not all manipulations are based on lies: e.g. telling the truth may be also a way to manipulate and induce somebody in the wrong way. That is why a manipulation should not be confused with its inner strategy. To summarize, manipulation has three fundamental characteristics:</p><p>(1) it is a deliberate effect of a manipulator (i.e. an applied strategy);</p><p>(2) it is an instrumentalization of a victim (i.e. an influence);</p><p>(3) it is always hidden from the victim (i.e. a concealment).</p><p>Consequently manipulation is an instrumentalization and it is concealed from the target. Hence, by considering a synthesis of the definitions given in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Akopova, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Cohen, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Handelman, 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Todd, 2013)</ref>, we retain the following definition of manipulation.</p><p>Definition 2.1. A manipulation is a deliberate effect of an agent (called a manipulator ) to instrumentalize another agent (called a victim), while making sure to conceal that effect.</p><p>It is important to notice that this definition makes sense in Artificial Intelligence literature, even in specific domains where manipulation has its own definition. In order to support our claim let us consider three domains: game theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Ettinger &amp; Jehiel, 2010)</ref>, social choice theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gibbard, 1973)</ref> and reputation systems <ref type="bibr">(Hoffman, Zage, &amp; Nita-Rotaru, 2009)</ref> where manipulation has been widely studied. Obvious manipulation is not limited to those domains. The interested reader may refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Masters et al. (2021)</ref> to have other examples.</p><p>(1) Game theory deals with the strategic interactions between agents and is based on the assumption they are rational, i.e. the agents always seek to maximize their personal or collective reward function according to the decisions they can make. In this setting, manipulation is just considered as a strategy: manipulators must decide if they have an interest to manipulate while victims must decide if they have an interest to not play an counter-manipulation strategy. A refinement of this notion has been proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Ettinger and Jehiel (2010)</ref>: manipulation is expressed through a Bayesian game on which the victims are associated to cognitive types that describe how much they believe the other types of player have a manipulation strategy, and how much they are able to distinguish the strategies of the various types of their opponents. Here, manipulation is a deliberate strategy (a chosen action) with instrumentalization (the manipulator's utility depends on the victim's strategy) and concealment (as the less the victim is able to distinguish the manipulation strategy, the more interest there is to manipulate). (2) Social choice theory deals with collective decision making based on the agents' preferences. Here, manipulation consists in as lying on our own preferences so as to obtain an outcome in our favor <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Gibbard, 1973)</ref>. Thus, it reduces manipulation as a particular strategy in which an agent is deliberately not sincere about its real preference profile. However, it also implies instrumentalization and concealment. Social choice theory deals with agents seeking for collective decisions.</p><p>A manipulator lies (its deliberate strategy) and pushes other agents to make a given collective decision (it is an intrumentalization). Concealment results from the fact that, to be effective, other agents must not be aware (or knowledgeable) of that strategy because, if it was the case, rational agents may adapt their behaviors to make the manipulation fail if it is in their interest (for instance by removing the manipulator from the decision process). (3) Reputation systems are systems where agents interact, collect, share, and aggregate the results of their past interactions to decide where they should be agents they can trust for future interactions. In this setting, manipulation consists in either lying on his identity (to avoid to accumulate bad evaluations), producing wrong evaluation (to increase or reduce another agent's reputation), interacting in order to blur the other agents (so they produce wrong evaluations), or do not collecting or sharing some messages in order to isolate another agent <ref type="bibr">(Hoffman, Zage, &amp; Nita-Rotaru, 2009)</ref>. As for the social choice theory, manipulation is here a deliberate strategy. Instrumentalization comes from the fact the manipulation wants to push the other agents to interact with him, or to forbid some agents to interact with the others. Finally, concealment comes from the fact that, if the other agents were aware or knew the manipulation, they should be able to isolate the manipulator.</p><p>While manipulation has been studied in multi-agent systems as a particular strategy or action e.g. in game theory or social choice theory as we showed, in this article we adopt a general position in regard to what is a manipulation in a multi-agent system by considering the definition 2.1. This definition makes clear the distinction with other related concepts such as e.g. coercion which is the instrumentalization of somebody by making him seeing a threat (thus without concealment) <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">(McCloskey, 1980)</ref>, persuasion which is the deliberate effect of changing beliefs (O'Keefe, 2015), lying which is the intention to induce a contrary beliefs from ours <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Mahon, 2008)</ref>, and so on. These concepts have been studied and disambiguated in the field of logic in multi-agent systems. Thus, in the next section, we provide a survey about related works in logic that are interested in defining such notions and how these formalisms can help us in defining manipulation.</p></div>

To do that they extend a propositional dynamic logic to a STIT logic and express a ex post knowledge K post i which characterizes an agent's knowledge assuming that the agent has made his decision about which action to take, but might still be uncertain about the decisions of others. Here, a deliberate STIT [{i}:dstit] is defined as seeing to it that something is true, which is not necessary true in the other worlds in a current moment. There is also a temporal operator 'next' X defined as the applied joint action in the current world and a belief modality B j . In their approach, persuasion is defined as a deliberate action through which an agent (persuader) changes the beliefs of another agent's (persuadee):</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">Persuades(i, j, ϕ) = K post i [{i}:dstit]XB j ϕ</formula><p>Based on this notion, they define deception as a persuasion in a proposition ϕ under the assumption that the persuader believes that ϕ is false.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">Deceives(i, j, ϕ) = Persuades(i, j, ϕ) ∧ B i X¬ϕ</formula><p>Here, truthfully telling is simply captured by persuasion, while deception always involves not telling the truth.

(2021)</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Sakama et al. (2015)</ref> consider predicates to express lying, deception, or persuasion, another approach Van Ditmarsch et al. ( <ref type="formula">2012</ref>) gets rid of representing those notions through predicates. Instead, they consider lying as a public announcement which is false, and they use a dynamic doxastic logic to describe the effects of lying through the semantics of the logical system. In this work, they consider a language L ll generated by the following BNF:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">ϕ ::= p|(ϕ 1 ∧ ϕ 2 )|¬ϕ| |⊥|B i ϕ|[ ‡ϕ 1 ]ϕ 2 |[!ϕ 1 ]ϕ 2 |[¡ϕ 1 ]ϕ 2</formula><p>In this language, they consider a set of modal operators and public announcement operators as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_12">• B i ϕ means the agent i believes that ϕ is true, • [!ϕ]</formula><p>ψ means that ψ is true after the public announcement of ϕ, • [¡ϕ]ψ means that ψ is true after the lie ϕ, • [ ‡ϕ]ψ means that ψ is true after the public announcement of ϕ but also true after the lie ϕ. To interpret these operators they first consider a doxastic model M = (W, {B i } i∈N , V ) with {B i } i∈N a set of serial, transitive and euclidean relations. Secondly they define an action model A p = (W α , {B α i } i∈N , I α , P α ) with I α : W α → L ll the precondition function and P α : W α → Sub Lll a function called postcondition function which assigns to each possible event a substitution which represents the effects of actions on variables. If A(L ll ) = {p 1 , . . . , p n } is the set of propositional variables of L ll , elements of Sub Lll are represented by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">{p 1 → σ 1 , . . . , p n → σ n |σ 1 , . . . , σ n ∈ L ll }</formula><p>The action model they use is described by Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> which expresses the effects of actions, here public announcements. For instance the event 1 : p represents the public announcement of p where p is true while 0 : ¬p represents the possible event when it is a lie i.e. p is announced while p is false. Furthermore let us notice that p can be substituted for any formula ϕ which means that public announcement are not necessary related to atomic propositions. Then, to define the effect of public announcement on the beliefs of the agents, this is given by a standard product update defined as (M, U ) ⊗ (A, S) = ((W ⊗ , {B ⊗ i } i∈N , V ⊗ ), U ⊗ ) where U ⊆ W, S ⊆ W α and:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">• W ⊗ = {(v, f ) ∈ W × W α : M, v |= I α (f )} • ∀(v, f ) ∈ W ⊗ , ∀i ∈ N , B ⊗ i (v, f ) = {(u, g) ∈ W ⊗ : u ∈ B i (v), g ∈ B α i (f )} • ∀(v, f ) ∈ W ⊗ : V ⊗ (v, f ) = {p ∈ A(L B )|M, w |= P (s)(p)} • U ⊗ := {(v, f )|v ∈ U, f ∈ S, (v, f ) ∈ W ⊗ }</formula><p>Finally, the semantics of the operators of L ll is given by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">• M, w |= B i ϕ iff ∀v ∈ W : wB i v, M, v |= ϕ • M, w |= [!ϕ]ψ iff (M, {w}) ⊗ (A ϕ , {1}), (w, 1) |= ψ • M, w |= [¡ϕ]ψ iff (M, {w}) ⊗ (A ϕ , {0}), (w, 0) |= ψ • M, w |= [ ‡ϕ]ψ iff (M, {w}) ⊗ (A ϕ , {0, 1}), (w, 0) |= ψ and (M, {w}) ⊗ (A ϕ , {0, 1}), (w, 1) |= ψ</formula><p>This semantics then gives the axiomatic system summarized in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>, the manipulative announcement is then described as [ ‡ϕ]ψ and by Ax0,</p><formula xml:id="formula_16">[ ‡ϕ]ψ ⇔ [!ϕ]ψ ∧ [¡ϕ]ψ.</formula><p>The rule A1 describes that if a public announcement ϕ brings the consequence p, then if ϕ is true, then necessarily p is true and vice versa.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Representing the effects of actions</head><p>As manipulation is a deliberate effect in order to instrumentalize an agent, it is of interest to reason on actions, their intended consequences, their side-effects, and how they can influence the other agents. Many formalisms exist. For instance, dynamic logics <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Harel, Kozen, &amp; Tiuryn, 2001)</ref> and temporal logics <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Alur, Henzinger, &amp; Kupferman, 2002)</ref> consider several action modalities where each action modality is associated with a program and its outputs. Dynamic epistemic logics express the logical consequences generated by public or private announcements of agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">(Van Ditmarsch, Van Der Hoek, &amp; Kooi, 2007)</ref>. Many other formalisms exist such as fluent calculus. For a detailed survey, the interested reader may refer to <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Segerberg, Meyer, &amp; Kracht, 2009)</ref>. Interestingly, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Giordano, Martelli, &amp; Schwind, 2000)</ref> propose a formalism that catches all ramification effects of actions i.e. all direct consequences and side-effects of actions. However such formalism introduces a distinct modality for each possible action, while we saw in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> that manipulation does not depend on particular actions or strategies (e.g. lying, rumor propagating, emotional blackmailing) but rather on its results. Thus, it is of interest to consider action logics which only represent abstract strategies that lead to a state-of-affair. Two approaches seem relevant: the STIT logics <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Balbiani, Herzig, &amp; Troquard, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Belnap &amp; Perloff, 1988;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lorini &amp; Sartor, 2016)</ref> and the BIAT logics <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(Pörn, 1977;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Santos &amp; Carmo, 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Troquard, 2014)</ref>, which both consider, in an abstract way, the fact of ensuring that something is done.</p><p>Both STIT and BIAT logics consider actions as the fruit of their consequences. This level of abstraction is well-adapted to define manipulation. BIAT considers a modality E i which means that the agent i brings it about. Let us notice it is side-effects free, i.e. indirect consequences of actions are not considered as intended effects. For its part, STIT considers a modality [ST IT ] i which means that the agent i sees to it that and catches all consequences of actions. Although these two approaches are often confused, the main difference between these two formalisms lies in the semantics of these modalities. STIT considers a S5 system<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> whereas BIAT is a non normal system based on neighborhood functions. Furthermore, STIT uses a notion of temporality while BIAT does not.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.1.">Representing influence</head><p>In the literature about STIT, some approaches already defined a notion of influence. Here, influence consists in seeing to it that another agent will see to it that something becomes true. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lorini and Sartor (2016)</ref> define the fact that agent i influences agent j on ϕ if, and only if, agent i sees to it that in the future, agent j rationally sees to it that ϕ, i.e.:</p><formula xml:id="formula_18">[inf l] i,j ϕ = [stit] i X[rstit] j ϕ</formula><p>where [rstit] is a primitive modal operator which represents the current choice as a rational choice. For its part, BIAT logics define influence similarly as the effect of an agent i to bring it about that another agent j brings about something. For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Bottazzi and Troquard (2015)</ref> considers the following predicate to define influence which is called interpersonal control :</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">[inf l] i,j ϕ = E i (E j ϕ ∧ ψ)</formula><p>The modality E i (resp. E j ) refers to a non-normal modality which means that agent i (resp. agent j) brings it about something. The formula ψ represents any formula of the language that does not contradict E j ϕ. This ψ is explicitly included in the definition of the predicate of influence because of the semantics which does not allow us to have the property of normal logics (ϕ ∧ ψ) ≡ ϕ ∧ ψ. If influence is defined only as E i E j ϕ and if a formula E i (E j ϕ ∧ ψ) is verified with ψ = , then since we do not have the property of normal logics, we could not be able to deduce the influence</p><formula xml:id="formula_20">E i E j ϕ from E i (E j ϕ ∧ ψ).</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.2.">Representing deliberate effects</head><p>While STIT approaches define influence, they also define a notion of deliberate effect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lorini and Sartor (2016)</ref> define deliberate effect by considering that something is done deliberately by another agent i if, and only if, i sees to it that something is true while it is not necessarily the case, that is to say:</p><formula xml:id="formula_21">[dstit] i ϕ = [stit] i ϕ ∧ ¬ ϕ</formula><p>However, this definition is not without problems. Let us imagine a situation in which one agent i deliberately causes a car crash to take advantage of car insurance. But during this car crash, a person died. By following the formal definition of Lorini and Sartor (2016)'s deliberate STIT, we would deduce that the agent i deliberately sees to it that "the car is crashed" but also, all indirect consequences as "a person is dead". Consequently by following STIT reasoning and since it was not necessarily the case (if the agent did not choose to cause this accident) that the person is dead, we would also deduce that i deliberately sees to it that "the person is dead". However we claim the opposite. Even if the agent i deliberately caused this car accident, he did not deliberately kill the victim. Furthermore a deliberate effect must be known by the agent. Indeed when we deliberately do or do not something, then we know what we are doing. Because they use standard STIT, <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Lorini and Sartor (2016)</ref> do not and cannot consider positive and negative introspection on knowledge. Let us notice that <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Broersen (2008)</ref> integrates a knowledge modality into the STIT language and defines a deliberate see to it such as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">[dxstit] i ϕ = K i [xstit] i ϕ ∧ K i ¬ Xϕ</formula><p>Here, <ref type="bibr">[xstit]</ref> i ϕ denotes that in the future, agent i sees to it that ϕ. Broersen (2008)'s deliberate STIT has the positive and negative introspection with knowledge. Furthermore it has also the side-effect free property since a consequence may not be known by the agent to consider it as a deliberate effect. A third important property that deliberate effects has to be verified which is the conjunction of all deliberate effects forms a deliberate effect. This property means that if agent i deliberately sees to it that ϕ and also deliberate sees to it that ψ, then he deliberately sees to it that ϕ ∧ ψ; and Broersen (2008)'s deliberate STIT has this property.</p><p>Concerning BIAT, as written previously, it explicitly defines a deliberate effect modality and it is side-effects free.</p></div>

The formula [r(p, i)]ϕ means that after revealing the value of p to an agent i, the formula ϕ is true, while [c(p, i)]ϕ means that after concealing the value of p to an agent i, the formula ϕ is true. These modalities are described in a PDL logical frame.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">A modal logic for manipulation</head><p>In this section, we propose a logic to represent the notion of manipulation as it has been defined in Section 2.1. Let us remark our goal is not to propose a definitive logic but rather to provide the basic elements to express such definition and disambiguate this concept.</p><p>To this end, we consider a logic with several modalities: deliberate effects, consequences of actions, belief and knowledge. One of the main element of this logic is the deliberate effect operator. Indeed, we require that this operator must have: (1) negative and positive introspection; (2) side-effect free; (3) the conjunction of all deliberate effects forms a deliberate effect. As written previously, STIT semantic catches all (direct and indirect) consequences of actions while BIAT semantics catches the deliberate effects. Moreover, since BIAT is side-effect free and makes it easy to express positive and negative introspection and also the conjunction of all deliberate effects forms a deliberate effect, we distinguish a modality of deliberate effects (expressed by a BIAT-like modality denoted E d i in the sequel) from a modality that catches all consequences of performed actions (expressed by a STIT-like modality denoted E i in the sequel). Thanks to these modalities, combined with knowledge and belief, we are able to express instrumentalization and concealment. Furthermore distinguishing an epistemic modal operator from a belief operator allows us to define different levels of concealment. Then, we chose to not introduce an awareness operator explicitly in the language and prefer to keep the logic simple. Finally, we also do not want the modality of future which increases the complexity of the model.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.2.">Semantics for the effects of actions</head><p>It is commonly accepted to consider the effects of action as an equivalence relationships, such as in STIT. Thus, for any agent i ∈ N , E i is a reflexive, transitive and Euclidean relationship<ref type="foot" target="#foot_4">5</ref> . Indeed, when an agent implements one or more actions, if he has carried them out, it means that this is the case and that the consequence ϕ is true. The reflexivity, denoted (E1), expresses the fact that once the actions leading to a certain ϕ consequence have been performed by an agent i, then that consequence ϕ is necessarily true in the current world. This constraint (E1) gives the axiom T. ∀w ∈ W : wE i w (E1)</p><p>From this constraint, we immediately deduce that this relation E i is also serial. This translates that if an agent i ensures that one or several actions lead to a certain consequence ϕ, it is not the case that this action or series of actions can lead to the opposite in the current world. So we deduce in such a system the property D. The relation E i is also transitive since when the actions of agent i lead to ϕ, these actions also lead to the fact that these actions are done properly, i.e.:</p><formula xml:id="formula_42">∀w, u, v ∈ W : wE i u ∧ uE i v ⇒ wE i v (E2)</formula><p>Finally, if an agent i does not perform actions that lead to some consequences ϕ, then agent i indirectly performs actions that lead to not realize the actions that lead to ϕ.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.3.">Semantic representation of deliberate effects</head><p>While the effects of actions are represented as an equivalence relationship, we represent deliberate effects as a neighborhood function. This semantic difference is justified by the fact that when an agent deliberately brings it about something, the latter considers as many sets of possible worlds as deliberate effects which has been carried out. Moreover, Kripke's relations do not allow us to express the fact that an agent cannot deliberately bring it about something that he always knows to be true, such as tautologies. It is due to the principle of necessity which is valid in any Kripke frame.</p><p>Thus, the first semantic difference with the E i modality is that an agent i cannot deliberately bring it about that a tautology to be true since he knows it is always true. This constraint, denoted E d N ec , is semantically translated by the fact that the set of all possible worlds cannot belong to any neighborhood, i.e.:</p><formula xml:id="formula_44">∀w ∈ W : W ∈ E d i (w) (E d N ec )</formula><p>Moreover, there is a logical link between the modality of deliberate effects and that of the effects of actions that may or may not be deliberate. Indeed, if an agent i deliberately brings it about some action, then this agent does these actions. It is represented by the constraint E d E which is semantically translated by the fact that all the possible worlds reachable by the relation E i are always included in all possible worlds sets of E d i , i.e.:</p><formula xml:id="formula_45">∀w ∈ W : S ∈ E d i (w) ⇒ E i (w) ⊆ S (E d E)</formula><p>When an agent i deliberately brings it about that a proposition ϕ to be true while deliberately bringing it about that another proposition ψ to be true, then that agent i deliberately brings it about that ϕ ∧ ψ to be true, i.e.:</p><formula xml:id="formula_46">∀w ∈ W : S ∈ E d i (w) ∧ T ∈ E d i (w) =⇒ S ∩ T ∈ E d i (w) (E ⇒,∧ )</formula><p>However, we cannot consider the reciprocal of (E ⇒,∧ ) because deliberate effects concern a whole and cannot be considered as the sum of its part. For example, when somebody decides to eat a hazelnut cake, he does not decide to deliberately eat the dough of the cake and eat the hazelnuts independently. Moreover, this reciprocal, defined by ∀w ∈ W :</p><formula xml:id="formula_47">S ∩ T ∈ E d i (w) =⇒ S ∈ E d i (w) ∧ T ∈ E d i (w) and associated with the theorem E d i (ϕ ∧ ψ) ⇒ E d i ϕ ∧ E d i ψ, cannot be considered for technical reasons. Indeed, an immediate result is that such constraint is equivalent to ∀w ∈ W : S ∈ E d i (w) ∧ S ⊆ T =⇒ T ∈ E d i (w)</formula><p>. Hence, if this reciprocal is considered, we would get an inconsistent logical system due to the constraint (E d N ec ).</p><p>Finally, an essential characteristic of deliberate effects is that it is introspective to the knowledge of agents. An agent always knows what it is doing and what it is not doing deliberately. Thus, the deliberate effect modality has positive (E d KP ) and negative introspection (E d KN ) with respect to the knowledge of the agent, i.e.:</p><formula xml:id="formula_48">∀w ∈ W : E d i (w) ⊆ v∈W:wKiv E d i (v) (E d KP ) ∀w, v ∈ W, ∀S ∈ 2 W : S ∈ E d i (w) =⇒ (wK i v ⇒ S ∈ E d i (v)) (E d KN )</formula><p>These constraints mean that when an agent i deliberately brings it about a consequence, she knows what she is doing deliberately. The same is true when an agent i does not deliberately bring it about that a consequence, then the agent i knows that she did not do it deliberately. Furthermore, let us notice that (E d KN ) is equivalent to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_49">∀w ∈ W, ∀S ∈ 2 W : S ∈ E d i (w) =⇒ S ∈ v∈W:wKiv E d i (v) (E d KN )</formula><p>Or simply by contraposition, (E d KN ) can be rewritten as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_50">∀w ∈ W, ∀S ∈ 2 W : v∈W:wKiv E d i (v) ⊆ E d i (w) (E d KN )</formula><p>Thus, we can deduce the following theorems, whose proofs are given in Appendix A.1:</p><formula xml:id="formula_51">Proposition 4.1. If (E d KN )</formula><p>and (E d KP ) hold at the same time, then it implies on the Kripke structure that the following property holds:</p><formula xml:id="formula_52">∀w ∈ W : E d i (w) = v∈W:wKiv E d i (v) = v∈W:wKiv E d i (v) (E d KN ) + (E d KP )</formula><p>Proposition 4.2.</p><p>(1) If (E d KP ) holds and K i is reflexive, then:</p><formula xml:id="formula_53">∀w ∈ W, E d i (w) = v∈W:wKiv E d i (v) (2) If (E d KN )</formula><p>holds and K i is reflexive, then:</p><formula xml:id="formula_54">∀w ∈ W, E d i (w) = v∈W:wKiv E d i (v)</formula><p>However considering for instance only the property (1) is not enough to verify that (E d KN ) and (E d KP ) hold at the same time. Thus, we can say that (E d KN ) is stronger than considering an equivalence between intersections. Indeed, (E d KN ) translates exactly that if an agent does not deliberate something, then it cannot be the case for all indistinguishable worlds by the epistemic relationship.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.4.">Illustration of semantic relations</head><p>Example 4.3 illustrates the fundamental differences between deliberate and nondeliberate effects. A deliberate effect is characterized as a calculated choice of an agent to achieve something, making the agent fully aware of the consequences, whereas a non-deliberate effect represents the set of all consequences of the actions of the agent which may be deliberate or not. Thus, the agent does not necessarily have knowledge of all these consequences.</p><p>Example 4.3. Suppose a situation in which there is a murderer i that deliberately brings it about to kill a victim j. In order to represent this situation we consider three propositional variables: p denotes that "the agent kills the victim by stabbing her", q denotes that "the agent gets arrested by the police", and r denotes that "there is no witness". For this situation, there are several possible worlds, for example, agent i kills the victim and does not get stopped by the police, the victim was already dead before the agent stabs her, agent i is remorseful and does not kill the victim, or the victim j wakes up and makes agent i run away, etc. Let us assume that a model M describes all of these possible worlds. Obviously we could consider a large number of possible worlds to describe this example, but for the sake of clarity, we consider only a small number of possible worlds. Let us assume M is such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_55">• W = {w, u, v, x, y, z, a} • V (p) = {w, u, v}, V (q) = {v, y, z}, V (r) = {w, x, y, z, a}</formula><p>The possible worlds are:</p><p>• w: "there is no witness, agent i kills the victim j and does not get arrested" • u: "there is a witness and agent i kills the victim j but does not get arrested" • v: "there is a witness and agent i kills the victim j and agent i gets arrested" • x: "the victim was already dead, no witness, and i does not get arrested" • y: "the victim was already dead, no witness, and agent i gets arrested" • z: "the killer is remorseful, no witness, and does not kill the victim, but agent i still gets arrested for attempted murder" • a: "no murder"</p><p>In the possible world w, the agent i therefore has a deliberate effect to kill the victim. In addition, he also takes care that there is no witness. So the neighborhood function is such that E d i (w) = {{w, u, v}, {w, x, y, z, a}}. It represents each independent strategy that agent i intended to implement in w:</p><p>• {w, u, v} represents the deliberate effect by agent i to kill the victim; • {w, x, y, z, a} represents the deliberate effect by agent i to ensure that there is no witness at the crime scene.</p><p>In the world w, agent i successfully manages to kill the victim without getting caught, so E i (w) = {w}. Furthermore in w, since agent i deliberately brings it about that there were no witness, we infer that the agent knows that p and r are true. So we have K i (w) = {w}, the only possible world where p and r are true simultaneously. The agent i cannot discern in w any other world than this one. Moreover in w, the agent knows that the police does not arrest him.</p><p>Let us remark that in this model semantics constraints, e.g. ∀w ∈ W : S ∈ E d i (w) ⇒ E i (w) ⊆ S, are naturally satisfied and illustrate the fact that since agent i deliberately brings it about in w to kill the victim, then this agent i deliberately brings it about that the victim is killed. Furthermore, since ||p|| ∈ E d i (w) we have M, w |= E d i p, i.e. agent i deliberately brings it about to kill the victim. Since the agent's strategic choice was to succeed in killing the victim, he set up a strategy to make p true.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Different kinds of manipulation</head><p>In terms of manipulation, a manipulator always intends to influence the intentions: by pushing his victim to do something, or by preventing his victim from doing something. It is the instrumentalization involved in Definition 2.1. Moreover, the manipulator always deliberately brings it about to conceal this instrumentalization. Thus, we can characterize manipulation depending on (1) what the manipulator wanted the victim to realize; (2) whether the victim deliberately brings it about to realize the manipulator's will; (3) how the manipulator intended to conceal. Hence, we consider constructive manipulations to be those where the manipulator brings about his victim to do something, and destructive manipulations when the manipulator aims at preventing an agent from doing something. Since manipulation is a deliberate effect of the manipulator, we also need to distinguish between bringing about another agent to do something in a deliberate way from doing it in an unintentional way. Thus, when the manipulator deliberately brings about the manipulated agent to deliberately bringing it about something, it relies on a strong instrumentalization. When the manipulator deliberately brings about the manipulated agent to do something in general, it relies on a soft instrumentalization. Finally we distinguish different forms of manipulation depending on whether the dissimulation is based on knowledge or beliefs: we call an epistemic concealment when the manipulator aims at preventing the victim to know his effects, and a doxastic concealment when the manipulator aims at preventing the victim from believing his intentions.</p><p>Tables <ref type="table">2</ref> and<ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> present different ways of expressing instrumentalization and concealment in the case of constructive manipulations and the case of destructive manipulations.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>. Constructive forms of manipulation</head><p>Table <ref type="table">2</ref> shows the different components of a constructive manipulation. For example, a strong instrumentalization is represented by the formula E d i E d j ϕ. Literally, this formula describes that the agent i employed a strategy leading the agent j deliberately bringing it about the consequence ϕ. A soft instrumentalization can be represented by the formula E d i E j ϕ. Finally, in the case of constructive manipulations, an epistemic concealment can be represented by the formula E d i ¬K j E d i E j ϕ and a doxastic concealment by the formula E d i ¬B j E d i E j ϕ. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref> describes the different components when a manipulation is destructive. For example, in this case of destructive manipulations, soft instrumentalization is Let us that notice that, for both constructive and destructive manipulations, an agent i cannot manipulate another agent j to deliberately brings about ϕ while concealing i deliberately brings j about bringing about ϕ as a side-effect (and inversely). This is due to the definition of manipulation we consider (see Definition 2.1): there is a manipulation when the effect of intrumentalization is the effect which is concealed. Thus, combining both a strong instrumentalization with the corresponding "soft" epistemic (or doxastic) and the soft instrumentalization with the corresponding "strong" epistemic (or doxastic) does not make sense.</p><formula xml:id="formula_66">Instrumentalization Concealment Strong (E d i ¬E d j ϕ) Epistemic (E d i ¬K j E d i ¬E d j ϕ) Soft (E d i ¬E j ϕ) Epistemic (E d i ¬K j E d i ¬E j ϕ) Strong (E d i ¬E d j ϕ) Doxastic (E d i ¬B j E d i ¬E d j ϕ) Soft (E d i ¬E j ϕ) Doxastic (E d i ¬B j E d i ¬E j ϕ)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.1.">The set of formulas Σ</head><p>In the sequel, we combine these different forms of instrumentalization and concealment to define all the forms of manipulation that can be expressed in KBE. Since we use a non-normal modality for E d i which does not have the theorem (ϕ ∧ ψ) ≡ ϕ ∧ ψ, we have to consider all other possible formulas that this agent may deliberately bring about at the same time. Indeed, an agent can manipulate another one while deliberately bringing about something else. However, without this theorem, we cannot deduce manipulation alone in this situation. One way to deal with this problem is to consider an explicit set of formulas on which we (as designers) allow the logic to reason, and to use this set to define predicates for manipulation. However, this set must be finite, otherwise the formulas that will characterize manipulation cannot be well-formed.</p><p>Thus, we introduce a set of formulas Σ which is finite, closed, and which contains P ∪ { , ⊥}. We consider the closure as <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Blackburn et al. (2002)</ref>: a set of formulas Σ is said to be closed if, and only if, (1) if σ ∈ Σ and θ is a subformula of σ, then θ ∈ Σ and (2) if σ ∈ Σ and σ is not of the form ¬θ, then ¬σ ∈ Σ. While Σ may be arbitrarily instantiated, it makes sense to ground it on a action-effect knowledge base: Σ shall be the closed set of all subformulas of this knowledge base. In order to manipulate the predicates that will use in the next sections a Σ-set, we introduce a new operator to define a conjunctive Cartesian product between two sets of formulas, i.e. Σ Γ := {σ ∧ γ : σ ∈ Σ, γ ∈ Γ}. This operator will allow us to rewrite these predicates in order to highlight logical relations between related concepts, as for instance between strong instrumentalization and the persuasion predicate.</p></div>

These intentions are not concealed and therefore we cannot speak of manipulation. On the other hand, it becomes manipulation when the advertiser uses concealed sales techniques such as, for example, the use of subliminal images. Thus, the advertiser does not seek to conceal his intention to bring the customer about buying the product, but to deliberately conceal the technique he uses to bring the customer about buying. If the agent i is the advertiser, E d i represents his strategy of using subliminal images to get the customer j to buy a product.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.1.">Believing being influenced</head><p>Obvioulsy, if an agent is a victim of an epistemic (resp. doxastic) manipulation, he cannot know (resp. believe) he is instrumentalized. However, an agent can believe he is instrumentalized while being a victim of an epistemic manipulation. It means that the victim may believe to be instrumentalized while being unable to prove it, i.e. it is not the case the agent knows he is instrumentalized. Indeed, when a child cries to get a new toy from his parents, the parents may believe the child deliberately puts himself in this state but cannot be sure it is the case.

In this case, the agent does not know (resp. believe) he is instrumentalized, i.e. the manipulator deliberately brings the victim about bringing about something, but he can know the manipulator influenced him. Indeed, the manipulation conceals the deliberate intention of the the manipulator, but not the influence in itself. It is given by the following theorem.</p><formula xml:id="formula_74">Theorem 5.4. |= M CEK Σ i,j (ϕ) ∧ K j E i E j ϕ ⇒ ⊥</formula><p>This property is obvious as there is no contradiction between ¬K j E d i E j ϕ and K j E i E j ϕ.

Interestingly such properties do not hold for deliberate effects, i.e. when ϕ = E d j ϕ . However, it allows us to express manipulation where the goal is to let a victim obliges or forbids herself by side-effect to apply a given strategy, e.g. to make a mistake that obliges or forbids herself to deliberately bring her about something.

For instance for constructive manipulation, such situations are expressed by:</p><formula xml:id="formula_79">• E d i (E d j E j ϕ ∧ ¬K j E d i E d j E j ϕ ) • E d i (E d j E j ϕ ∧ ¬B j E d i E d j E j ϕ ) • E d i (E d j ¬E j ϕ ∧ ¬K j E d i E d j ¬E j ϕ ) • E d i (E d j ¬E j ϕ ∧ ¬B j E d i E d j ¬E j ϕ</formula><p>) Finally, we have the case where ϕ = E d j ϕ . In this case, it correspond to manipulation where the goal is to instrumentalize a victim in order she puts herself a situation where she deliberately brings about something or deliberately forbid herself to bring about something, e.g. pushing a drug-addict to attach himself in order to not be able to take drug.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.1.">Coercion</head><p>The coercion is an influence of an agent over another agent by means of pressure without any dissimulation. For instance, a robber pointing a gun at somebody so as to get his wallet is not trying to manipulate the victim but he is influencing his behavior. The robber deliberately ensures that the victim knows or believes that he is under pressure (by pointing the gun). As manipulation, coercion can be expressed in a constructive or a destructive form. Thus, coercion can be defined formally with several predicates, i.e. constructive epistemic coercion, constructive doxastic coercion, destructive epistemic coercion and destructive doxastic coercion:</p><formula xml:id="formula_84">CKCoe Σ i,j (ϕ) = ψ∈Σ E d i (E d j ϕ ∧ K j E d i E d j ϕ ∧ ψ) CBCoe Σ i,j (ϕ) = ψ∈Σ E d i (E d j ϕ ∧ B j E d i E d j ϕ ∧ ψ) DKCoe Σ i,j (ϕ) = ψ∈Σ E d i (¬E d j ϕ ∧ K j E d i ¬E d j ϕ ∧ ψ) DBCoe Σ i,j (ϕ) = ψ∈Σ E d i (¬E d j ϕ ∧ B j E d i ¬E d j ϕ ∧ ψ)</formula><p>Obviously, coercion is a particular case of strong instrumentalization.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.3.">Deception</head><p>Deception consists in an agent making another believing something while hiding it some aspects linked to the newly believed statement. It may be half-truth, or deception by omission <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(Sakama et al., 2015)</ref>. Let us focus on source concealment (namely hiding the deliberate effects to make another agent into believing something) and credible lies (namely hiding we believe the opposite of the statement we want the other agent to believe). Interestingly, both cases can be defined as a special case of persuasion. Source concealment can represent agents that spread rumors. For instance, in the case of stock exchange market, it happens that some agents spread rumors in order to influence the others to buy or sell a product without they know that it is a part of their strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Aggarwal &amp; Wu, 2006)</ref>. Thus, it can be characterized by the fact that an agent makes sure to conceal -from an epistemic (resp. doxastic) point-of-view -his deliberate effects to make someone believes something. Thus, we can define epistemic (resp. doxastic) source concealment as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_90">KSoCo Σ i,j (ϕ) = ψ∈Σ E d i (B j ϕ ∧ ¬K j E d i B j ϕ ∧ ψ) BSoCo Σ i,j (ϕ) = ψ∈Σ E d i (B j ϕ ∧ ¬B j E d i B j ϕ ∧ ψ)</formula><p>Mahon defines lying as "to make a believed-false statement (to another person) with the intention that that statement be believed to be true (by the other person)" <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Mahon, 2008)</ref>. Thus, a statement is a lie if there is also a deliberate effect to conceal the intended effects to lie, from an epistemic or a doxastic point-of-view. We call such a lie an epistemic (reps. doxastic) credible lie:</p><formula xml:id="formula_91">KCrLie Σ i,j (ϕ) = B i ¬ϕ ∧ ( ψ∈Σ E d i (B j ϕ ∧ ¬K j B i ¬ϕ ∧ ψ)) BCrLie Σ i,j (ϕ) = B i ¬ϕ ∧ ( ψ∈Σ E d i (B j ϕ ∧ ¬B j B i ¬ϕ ∧ ψ))</formula><p>One property of credible lie is that an agent cannot lie to another one in order to make the victim believes he deliberately brings about something. Indeed, due to Theorem 5.10(1), believing to deliberately bring about ϕ implies deliberately bringing about ϕ, and the persuader would believe it while he should not. It is given by the next theorem.</p><p>Theorem 5.13.</p><formula xml:id="formula_92">(1) KCrLie Σ i,j (E d j ϕ) ⇒ ⊥ (2) BCrLie Σ i,j (E d j ϕ) ⇒ ⊥ (3) KSoCo Σ i,j (E d j ϕ) ⇔ M CE d K Σ i,j (ϕ) (4) BSoCo Σ i,j (E d j ϕ) ⇔ M CE d B Σ i,j (ϕ) (5) KCrLie Σ i,j (ϕ) ⇒ P er Σ {¬KjBi¬ϕ} i,j<label>(ϕ)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_93">(6) BCrLie Σ i,j (ϕ) ⇒ P er Σ {¬BjBi¬ϕ} i,j<label>(ϕ)</label></formula><p>We can compare the persuasion and deception definitions we propose here to the literature presented in Section 3.1. Firstly, we do not need to introduce explicit communication modality as <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Sakama et al. (2015)</ref> did. Here, the communication is expressed (more precisely reduced) to a deliberate effect of having an influence on the mental state of another agent, e.g. making the agent believing something, or making him bringing about something. Obviously, communication in a whole cannot be reduced to just that, e.g. when an agent asks a question, or apologize, or publicly commit himself to do something, etc. Our notion of persuasion is syntactically close to the one proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bonnet et al. (2021)</ref> -deliberately seeing to it that the persuadee believes something -except we do not consider a temporal modality. Our notion of deception is however different as we explicitly consider concealment, which is not the case in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Bonnet et al. (2021)</ref>. The same remark holds for lie when compared to the one proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Sakama et al. (2015)</ref>.</p></div>

Moreover, we can notice that</p><formula xml:id="formula_103">||¬K j E d i E j q|| = {w, v, a} 8 and {w, v, a} ∈ E d i (w).

This agent also has the strategy to get the other agent to buy the product with the set ||E d i p ⇒ E d i E j q|| = {w, u, a}, and his dissimulation strategy is represented by the set ||¬K j E d i E j q|| = {w, v, a}.

Secondly, notice that ||E d i E j q|| = {w, u} and since ∀x ∈ W, uK j x, M, x |= E d i E j q, we have M, u |= K j E d i E j q and so u ∈ ||¬K j E d i E j q||. 9 To make sure, just compute the set ||E d i E d j q|| = {w, u} and so the only possible world x such that ∀z ∈ W, xK j z, M, z |= E d i E d j q is the world x = u.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.">Conclusion and future works</head><p>In this article, we provide a broad state-of-the-art about manipulation in social science. We used this state-of-the-art to define manipulation as the deliberate effect to instrumentalize a victim while making sure to conceal that effect. We proposed a logical framework to reason about this notion. To this end, we defined a new deliberate BIAT modality for deliberate effects. We then considered logical interactions between knowledge, belief, deliberate effects and consequences of actions and proved that our system is strongly sound and complete. Furthermore we deduced several theorems such as concealment of contrary beliefs and qui facit per alium facit per se principle. Finally we gave an explicit definition of what manipulation is, and we modeled coercion, persuasion and deception differently such as highlighted by the literature.</p><p>In terms of perspectives, future works are twofold. Firstly, it may be of interest to formalize deliberated intention in a deeper way. Indeed, KBE neither consider temporal nor dynamic operators while they are necessary to express actions and their consequences. Secondly, expressing more kind of manipulation is of interest. For instance, it should be interesting to extend the framework with awareness so as to define new manipulation forms with awareness concealment. As another example, extending KBE with other mental state can be of interest to model manipulation strategies such as presented in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.1.">Extending KBE to awareness logics</head><p>When we defined manipulation such as the deliberate effect to instrumentalize an agent while making sure to conceal that effect, we defined concealment as a lack of knowledge or belief about the manipulator's effects. However, in many situations, a manipulated agent is unaware that he or she has been manipulated. In section 3.3, we have presented work on the representation of awareness. One perspective is to integrate awareness into manipulation.</p><p>We could for instance consider a modality A i to represent that agent i is aware of something, as proposed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Schipper (2014)</ref>. Let Σ be a set of formulas that is closed and finite such as { , ⊥} ⊆ Σ, ϕ ∈ Σ and A i : W → 2 Σ be the awareness function associated with the modality A i . We could then define new forms of manipulations with absence of awareness. Thus, a soft constructive manipulation with absence of awareness would be defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_109">M CEA Σ i,j (ϕ) = ψ∈Σ E d i (E j ϕ ∧ ¬A j E d i E j ϕ ∧ ψ)</formula><p>A strong constructive manipulation with absence of awareness would be defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_110">M CE d A Σ i,j (ϕ) = ψ∈Σ E d i (E d j ϕ ∧ ¬A j E d i E d j ϕ ∧ ψ)</formula><p>A soft destructive manipulation with absence of awareness would be defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_111">M DEA Σ i,j (ϕ) = ψ∈Σ E d i (¬E j ϕ ∧ ¬A j E d i ¬E j ϕ ∧ ψ)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>40</head><p>A strong destructive manipulation with absence of awareness would be defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_112">M DE d A Σ i,j (ϕ) = ψ∈Σ E d i (¬E d j ϕ ∧ ¬A j E d i ¬E d j ϕ ∧ ψ)</formula><p>Furthermore, note that in this case the function A i is such that for any w ∈ W, A i (w) ⊆ Σ. That means that, in such a system, we assume agents are never aware of formulas that are not in Σ.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7.2.">Extending KBE with other mental states</head><p>We also could consider mental states other than awareness, in particular mental states on which a manipulation strategy relies (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). Indeed, while our KBE system can express strategies based on an agent's beliefs and knowledge as with deception or lying, we cannot express other forms of strategies when they are based on the agents' desires, norms, or when they are based on trust in the sincerity that one agent gives to another agent.</p><p>In a previous work, we propose a logic -called TB system -in which a modality T s j,i expresses the fact that an agent i trusts the sincerity of an agent i about something <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Leturc &amp; Bonnet, 2018)</ref>. A perspective would consist in merging the KBE system and the TB system. By merging them we would be able to deduce new theorems such as if an agent j trusts the sincerity of another agent i about the fact that i does not instrumentalize him, then it cannot be the case that agent j believes that i can instrumentalize him. This theorem would be represented by the following formula:</p><formula xml:id="formula_113">T s j,i ¬E d i E j ϕ ⇒ ¬B j E d i E j ϕ</formula><p>We would then have new forms of manipulation whose concealment would be based on trust between two agents.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2.3. Soundness properties</head><p>In this section, we give the complete proof of soundness.</p><p>Theorem 4.4. The KBE system is sound.</p><p>Proof. In order to show soundness, we have to show that substitution, modus ponens, necessitation, (RE) and (DUAL) preserve the validity for all modalities.</p><p>(1) Let us prove that substitution preserves validity. Let ϕ ∈ L KBE be a formula and p a1 , . . . , p an ∈ P be propositional atoms that are contained in ϕ. We define θ = ϕ(ψ 1 /p a1 , . . ., ψ n /p an ) the obtained formula after an uniform substitution on ϕ and ψ 1 , . . . , ψ n ∈ L KBE formulas. We want to prove that if ϕ is valid in C, then θ is also valid in C. By contraposition let us assume that C |= θ. So there exists a model M = (C, h) and a world w ∈ W such that: M, w |= θ. Let us build a model for ϕ, M = (C, h ) such that:</p><formula xml:id="formula_139">• ∀j ∈ N : 1 ≥ j ≥ n, M, w |= ψ j =⇒ w ∈ h (p aj ) • ∀j ∈ N : 1 ≥ j ≥ n, M, w |= ψ j =⇒ w / ∈ h (p aj ) • ∀p ∈ P : ∀j ∈ N : p = p aj , w / ∈ h (p) 12</formula><p>Since M, w |= θ, we have that the combination of ψ j invalidate formula θ in M, w. Since for all ψ j we associate an atom p aj language with the same truth value as the formula as ψ j . The combination of p aj invalidate the formula ϕ in M , w. Thus, we have M , w |= ϕ. It has therefore been well proven by contraposition that substitution preserves validity, i.e. if ϕ is valid in C then its substitution ψ is also valid in C. (3) Let us prove that necessitation preserves validity for all ( , R) ∈ </p><formula xml:id="formula_140">{(B i , B i ), (K i , K i ), (E i , E i )}.</formula><formula xml:id="formula_141">= W \ (W \ ||ϕ|| M ) and ||¬ϕ|| M = W \ ||ϕ|| M .

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3.7. Completeness proof</head><p>In this section, we give the complete proof of completeness.</p><p>Theorem 4.5. The KBE system is complete.</p><p>Proof. (Completeness) By definition, we have that for all valid formulas ϕ in the frame C, ϕ is valid in all models M on C. Thus, since the canonical model is a KBE model from Lemma A.18, ϕ is also valid in the canonical model M c . So, from the all KBE-consistent sets Γ, there exists a world w ∈ W c satisfying all formulas of Γ in the canonical model M c . Finally we give the proof of the strong completeness of KBE.</p><p>Theorem A.21 (Strong completeness of KBE). Let ϕ ∈ L KBE be a formula and for all sets Γ ⊆ L KBE of formulas, we have that the system KBE is strongly complete i.e. if Γ |= ϕ, then Γ ϕ.</p><p>Proof. By contraposition, let Γ ⊆ L KBE be a set of formulas such that Γ ϕ, we have that Γ ∪ {¬ϕ} is a KBE-consistent set. Indeed, by absurdity, if we have Γ ∪ {¬ϕ} is KBE-inconsistent, then we would have that there exists ψ 1 , . . . , ψ n ∈ Γ such that ¬(ψ 1 ∧ . . . ∧ ψ n ∧ ¬ϕ), and so we would also have (ψ 1 ∧ . . . ∧ ψ n ) ⇒ ϕ. However by deduction theorem, we would deduce that Γ ∪ {ψ 1 , . . . , ψ n } ϕ, i.e. Γ ϕ, which contradicts the hypothesis Γ ϕ. Thus, by lemma A.20, there exists a model M (the canonical model) and a world w such that M, w |= Γ ∪ {¬ϕ}, i.e. M, w |= Γ and M, w |= ¬ϕ. Consequently we have proved that there exists a model M such that M, Γ |= ϕ.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3.3. Maximal KBE-consistent sets</head><p>First of all let us recall some well-known results about maximal consistent sets. A set of formulas Σ is inconsistent if, and only if, ∃ψ 1 , . . . , ψ n ∈ Σ : ¬ n i=1 ψ i . A set of formulas Σ is consistent iff Σ is not inconsistent. A set of formulas Γ is a maximal consistent iff Γ : Γ Γ , Γ consistent. It leads us to the well-known Lindenbaum's lemma: for all consistent sets of formulas Γ , there exists a set of formulas Γ s.t Γ ⊆ Γ and Γ is a maximal consistent set (MCS). Let us consider a MCS Γ and ϕ, ψ ∈ L KBE two formulas:</p><p>In order to prove that our system is complete, we are doing a Henkin-like proof.

Thus, n k=1 ψ k ∈ w (MCS3') and so { ψ 1 , . . . , ψ n } is KBE-consistent. But { ψ 1 , . . . , ψ n } ∪ {¬ ϕ} is KBE-inconsistent. So ¬ ϕ cannot belong to the set of maximal KBE-consistent formulas w. Indeed by reductio ad absurdum, if we have ¬ ϕ ∈ w, we would also have that n k=1 ψ k ∧ ¬ ϕ ∈ w (by MCS3'), and { ψ 1 , . . . , ψ n , ¬ ϕ} would be KBE-consistent, which is a contradiction. Thus, ¬ ϕ / ∈ w. Consequently we prove that if ¬ ϕ ∈ w, then R * (w) ∪ {¬ϕ} is KBEconsistent.</p><p>Lemma A.13. Let i, j ∈ N and ϕ, ψ ∈ L KBE be a formula,</p><p>We need a second lemma to demonstrate the completeness of our system.

By the previous lemma, we have R * (w) ∪ {¬ψ} is KBE-consistent and so, by the Lindenbaum's lemma, there exists v ∈ W c : R * (w) ∪ {¬ψ} ⊆ v and v is maximal KBE-consistent set. So we have ¬ψ ∈ v and, by definition of R c , we have wR c v. Furthermore, we have ψ / Lemma A.17, we have ϕ. Consequently, we have proved that the KBE system is complete.</p></div>
