<div><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Accurate knowledge of the identity, the geographic distribution and the evolution of bird species is essential for a sustainable development of humanity as well as for biodiversity conservation. Monitoring avian populations is one of the most important approaches to assess ecosystems in terms of conservation priority-especially in regions with high overall biological diversity which often face extinction. Acoustic monitoring using Autonomous Recording Units (ARU) allows researchers to conduct point counts in almost any densely vegetated habitat over longer periods of time and has become a widely used sampling tool in ecological research and monitoring over the past decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>While automated assessment of soundscapes in the hyper-diverse tropics presents significant challenges relative to less diverse systems, it also presents higher upside. The tropics harbor a hugely disproportionate percentage of Earth's biodiversity, more than three-quarters of all species and over 90% of the planet's terrestrial birds, and international biodiversity targets will be impossible to meet if these systems are not conserved <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Despite their critical importance, however, the tropics are widely neglected in biodiversity and ecosystem function literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, and conclusions from studies in temperate regions are often wrongly used as the basis for assumptions about tropical systems where they do not apply <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. The avian species richness in regions like the Amazon is so high that conducting reliable avian surveys in the Amazon is too overwhelming for most field observers, particularly when combined with the logistical challenges and poor viewing conditions typical of dense tropical forests <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. Biased research priorities and difficulties with field surveys in the tropics have led to overlooked biodiversity losses <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and flawed baseline species occurrence data <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, which introduce significant problems for assessing biodiversity change. ARUs, a costeffective way of collecting data in systems that are difficult to access and survey, are well suited to address many of these issues by generating detailed data that can be recorded simultaneously, stored permanently, reviewed by multiple observers, and that is far less impacted by open or closed habitats than point counts, which can lead to the relative overestimation of species richness and abundance at sites with more favorable viewing conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</p><p>The improvement of automated assessment systems has the potential to have a transformative impact on global biodiversity monitoring, at a scale and level of detail that is impossible with manual annotation or other more traditional methods. Building automated assessment programs that can handle the unique challenges of hyper-diverse tropical ecosystems must become a central priority for conservation organizations and research groups with an interest in protecting Earth's biodiversity.</p></div>
<div><head n="2">BirdCLEF 2020 challenge description</head><p>The high amount of effort required to manually analyse recorded soundscapes means that fully analyzing large datasets is prohibitively time-intensive, neutralizing many of the advantages provided by continuous recording across multiple sites. The <software ContextAttributes="used">LifeCLEF</software> Bird Recognition Challenge (<software ContextAttributes="used">BirdCLEF</software>) focuses on the development of reliable detection systems for avian vocalizations in continuous soundscape data. Launched in 2014, it has become the largest bird sound recognition competition in terms of dataset size and species diversity with multiple tens of thousands of recordings covering up to 1,500 species <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div><head n="2.1">Goal and evaluation protocol</head><p>The goal of the evaluated task is to localize and identify all audible birds within the provided soundscape test set. Each soundscape is divided into segments of 5 seconds, and a list of species associated to probability scores has to be returned for each segment. The used evaluation metric is the classification mean Average Precision (cmAP ), considering each class c of the ground truth as a query. This means that for each class c, all predictions with ClassId = c are extracted from the run file and ranked by decreasing probability in order to compute the average precision for that class. The mean across all classes is computed as the main evaluation metric. More formally:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">cmAP = C c=1 AveP (c) C</formula><p>where C is the number of classes (species) in the ground truth and AveP (c) is the average precision for a given species c computed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">AveP (c) = nc k=1 P (k) × rel(k) n rel (c) .</formula><p>where k is the rank of an item in the list of the predicted segments containing c, n c is the total number of predicted segments containing c, P (k) is the precision at cut-off k in the list, rel(k) is an indicator function equaling 1 if the segment at rank k is a relevant one (i.e. is labeled as containing c in the ground truth) and n rel (c) is the total number of relevant segments for class c.</p></div>
<div><head n="2.2">Dataset</head><p>The <software>2020 BirdCLEF</software> challenge featured the largest, fully-annotated collection of soundscape recordings from four different recording locations : in Peru, Germany and two in USA. With respect to real-world use cases, labels and metrics were chosen to reflect the vast diversity of bird vocalizations and high ambient noise levels in omnidirectional recordings.</p><p>Training data: Deploying a bird sound recognition system to a new recording and observation site requires classifiers that generalize well across different acoustic domains. Focal recordings of bird species from around the world form an excellent base to develop such a detection system. However, the lack of annotated soundscape data for a new deployment site poses a significant challenge. As in previous editions, training data was provided by the Xeno-canto community<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> and consisted of more than 70,000 recordings covering 960 species from three continents (South and North America and Europe). Participants were allowed to use this and other (meta) data to develop their systems. A representative validation dataset with two hours of soundscape data was also provided, but participants were not allowed to use this data for training-detection systems had to be trained on focal recordings only. Test data: In addition to the 2019 test data <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, soundscapes from three other recording sites were added in the 2020 edition of <software ContextAttributes="used">BirdCLEF</software>. All audio data were collected with passive acoustic recorders from deployments in Germany (GER), Peru (PER), the High Sierra Nevada (HSN) of California-USA, and the Sapsucker Woods area (SSW) in New York-USA (locations are illustrated Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). In an attempt to lower the entry level of this challenge, the total amount of soundscape data was reduced to 153 recordings with a duration of ten minutes each (25.5 hours total). Expert ornithologists provided annotations for often extremely dense acoustic scenes with up to 8 species (1.3 on average) vocalizing at the same time (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</p><p>PER -Inkaterra Reserva Amazonica, Peru: This acoustic data was collected at the Inkaterra Reserva Amazonica (henceforth "ITRA", 12  The reserve consists primarily of seasonally inundated Várzea forest. The western Amazon is the most biodiverse terrestrial system on the planet <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and is part of the world's largest remaining intact tropical system <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. The region's extraordinary biodiversity is threatened by accelerating rates of deforestation, degradation, and fragmentation, which are driven primarily by expanding road networks, mining, agriculture, and an increasing population <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>. ITRA is actively threatened by these processes, particularly encroachment from small-scale agriculture and selective logging, which has occurred illegally within its boundaries (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>). These threats are magnified by the site's proximity to Puerto Maldonado, the largest settlement in the region, which can be reached via an unmarked road that passes within 1km of the reserve.</p><p>The acoustic data from this site was collected as part of a study designed to assess spatio-temporal variation in avian species richness and vocal activity levels across intact, degraded, and edge forest, and between different days at the same point locations. ITRA is expected to experience permanent changes to its species composition and richness in coming years, as a result of the accelerating deforestation, degradation, and fragmentation in the region, as well as climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. Similar processes, including the extirpation of certain species, have been documented in forest fragments in other parts of the Amazon <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. The impending changes to ITRA's soundscape mean that high-quality historic bioacoustic data is likely to be of particular value for future comparative studies, including those concerning primates, bats, katydids, and other non-avian taxa. Accordingly, collecting this data for archival reasons was an important incentive for the project.</p><p>Ten SWIFT recording units, provided by the Center for Conservation Bioacoustics at the Cornell Lab. of Ornithology<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> , were placed at separate sites span- ning edge habitat, degraded forest, and intact forest within the reserve. These omnidirectional recorders were set to record continuously for the duration of their deployment, with a sampling rate of 48kHz, and a gain setting of 35dB. Sites were separated by approximately 350m to limit the chance of overlapping detection, and to ensure independence between sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Recorders were placed at a consistent height of approximately 1.5m above the ground. To minimize background noise, all sites used for data analysis were located at a minimum distance of 450m from the river.</p><p>A total of 21 dawn-hours, from 05:00-06:00 PET (10:00-11:00 UTC), representing 7 of the 10 sites on three randomly-selected dates, were manually annotated. Many neotropical bird species sing almost exclusively during the dawn hour <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, so this time window was selected to maximize the number of species present in the recordings. Roughly 20,000 individual bounding box annotations, representing 123 foreground species, were made for all audible bird vocalizations (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). Annotations were particularly focused on vocalizations at frequencies below 5kHz, which were less likely to overlap with insect noise. Because these annotations included varying numbers of unidentified vocalizations, 9 of the 21 total dawn-hours, with the highest quality annotations and lowest share of unknown vocalizations, were used for <software ContextAttributes="used">BirdCLEF</software> 2020. These 9 recordings featured 6,399 foreground annotations, 1.6% of which were unidentified, and 4.6% of which were either unidentified or grouped with other vocalizations of the same type, but were not connected to a known species or taxa.</p><p>HSN -Sierra Nevada/High Sierra, CA, USA: The recordings were made in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, two contiguous national parks on the southern end of the Sierra Nevada mountain range in California, USA. Ninety-six percent of the Parks' 865,964 acres is federally designated wilderness, which affords the highest level of protection to the land from human develop-ment. The Parks' boundary spans several biomes, from mid-elevation chaparral and conifer and Sequoia forest to alpine tundra and includes the highest peak in the lower 48 states, Mount Whitney/Tumanguya<ref type="foot" target="#foot_2">3</ref> .</p><p>The focus of the acoustic study was the high-elevation region of the Parks; specifically, the headwater lake basins above 3km in elevation. These lake basins are comprised primarily of perennial graminoid vegetation (wet grasses and forbs), sparse evergreen woodland (foxtail and whitebark pine), riparian scrub (primarily willow/Salix sp.), and talus or boulderfield (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). The avian community becomes less speciose above timberline due to decreased overall productivity compared to lowland and montane zones <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>. Alpine areas are highly seasonal, covered in deep snowpack for roughly half the year.</p><p>The original intent of the study was to monitor seasonal activity of birds and bats at lakes containing trout and lakes without trout. Recreational trout stocking in the historically fishless lakes of the Sierra Nevada began in the late 1800's, and though it was phased out in the National Parks in the 1970's and banned altogether in 1991, self-sustaining populations of trout persist in roughly 50% of the High Sierra's historically fishless watershed <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. The disruptive effects of introduced trout within the aquatic system are well-studied: the diversity, distribution and abundance of many native aquatic fauna are vastly reduced in lakes containing trout <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>. However, the cascading impacts of trout on the adjacent terrestrial zone remain poorly understood, despite the importance of aquatic-terrestrial subsidies in the food web dynamics of many ecological systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</p><p>Additional support for this project from the Parks was due to the fact that high-elevation areas are particularly vulnerable to climate change: range contractions for alpine specialists and drastic turnover to the composition of alpine communities are predicted due to changes in temperature and precipitation regimes linked to global climate change <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Most importantly, these changes are likely to happen heterogeneously across taxa as species distributions shift over both space and time to track their thermal niches, changing food supply, and/or habitat structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, making conservation decisions nuanced and difficult. Highquality data with large-scale replicability on the occurrence and distribution of alpine species is a pressing need for understanding extinction risk and conserving biodiversity as the climate changes. However, data collection in wilderness is limited by difficulty in accessibility: in the absence of roads, researchers must travel on foot for several kilometers simply to reach these remote alpine locations. Passive acoustic recorders are a promising tool to collect such data because they can be deployed at multiple locations, generate a permanent and unbiased record of vocal animal activity, and can be used into the future as both research needs and analytical technologies evolve <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</p><p>Soundscapes were recorded for 24h continuously at 10 lakes (5 fishless, 5 fishcontaining) throughout Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks during June-September 2015. Pilot data were collected at a subset of these lakes during the same months in 2014. <software>SongMeter</software> SM2+ units (Wildlife Acoustics, USA) powered by custom-made solar panels were used to obviate the need to swap batteries, due to the recording locations being extremely difficult to access. <software ContextAttributes="used">SongMeters</software> recorded mono-channel 16-bits wav files continuously. This resulted in roughly 6TB of data, which were stored on external hard drives, servers at Cornell University, and backed up in Google Cloud Storage. To create an annotated subset of data used as evaluation data in the <software ContextAttributes="used">2020 BirdCLEF</software> challenge, 50 10-minute segments of audio between 9 and 12 July, 2015 from morning hours (05:10-09:10 PDT) from all 10 sites were selected at random. One expert annotated this subset: using <software ContextAttributes="used">RavenPro</software> 1.5, a selection box was placed around each sound and annotated it to species. Every sound that could not be confidently assigned an identity was reviewed with 1-2 other experts in bird identification. When consensus on ID could not be reached, the sound was marked as "unknown." To minimize observer bias, all identifying information about the location, date and time of the recordings was hidden. We used high-quality sound-cancelling headphones to minimize variation in the ambient environment that would interfere with hearing. We observed that it was difficult to reliably identify sounds with an absolute maximum amplitude less than 40dB; therefore, we only annotated sounds that exceeded this amplitude. SSW -Sapsucker Woods, Ithaca, NY, USA: As part of the Sapsucker Woods Acoustic Monitoring Project (SWAMP), the Center for Conservation Bioacoustics at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology deployed 30 in-house developed acoustic recorders (called SWIFT) to the surrounding area. Each of the units records acoustic data at 48kHz sampling rate covering the frequency of all bird calls occurring in Sapsucker Woods. The ongoing study aims at investigating the vocal activity and diversity of local bird species as well as the impact of noise pollution (the local airport and highway 13 are in close proximity) on the behaviour of birds-especially focusing on changes in vocal output as anthropogenic sounds may alter the way that birds communicate. Over the past four years, more than 1 million hours of soundscape data have been recorded and stored. This amount of data is only fully accessible through automated analysis by using reliable detection systems that are robust against unforeseen environmental sounds and cope well with overlapping vocalizations. In 2018, expert birders annotated 20 complete days of audio data that were recorded between January and June of 2017 and provided almost 80,000 labels across randomly selected recordings (24 out of 30 recording sites per day with one hour per site). The 2019 edition of <software ContextAttributes="used">BirdCLEF</software> used twelve of these days as test and three as validation data. This year, we limited the amount of test data to 48 10-minute recordings that also include previously unreleased audio from this deployment. This reduction became necessary to balance the test data and to reduce the bias towards one dataset. Six randomly selected recordings were provided as validation data to allow participants to fine-tune their systems. However, we chose to only release validation data for the SSW and PER dataset which forced participants to develop generic approaches that are location-independent.</p><p>GER -Laubach, Hesse, Germany: Forests, the habitat of woodpeckers, owls and other bird species, are increasingly being used as locations for wind farms in the wake of the transformation of energy production. Noise, movement or scenery effects could have a disturbing impact on these forest bird species and lead to the avoidance of forest areas near wind farms. Using automated acoustic recorders, this study aimed to investigate whether wind farms lead to a change in the use of forest habitats by selected bird species. In order to produce reliable and objectively recorded data in sufficient quantities to be able to investigate relatively small effects, passive acoustic monitoring is extremely valuable and above all cost-effective, which is what makes this kind of study possible in the first place. On the other hand, acoustic monitoring is also suitable for the detection and monitoring of rare, endangered or particularly sensitive animals, which could not be monitored by human observers. Yet, only automatic processing of the recordings allows us to handle such data quantities.</p><p>Over the course of two seasons (March to June 2019 and 2020), 100 solarpowered passive recorders (based on a Raspberry Pi 3 A+ with USB soundcard and mono microphone) were deployed across 11 wind parks with close-proximity forest (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). Each device started to record for two hours around sunrise (one before, one after) and one hour after sunset. The entire data collection comprised 25,000 hours of audio data. We randomly selected 9 soundscapes with a duration of 10 minutes each and annotated all audible bird vocalizations using <software ContextAttributes="used">Audacity</software>. The selection included dawn chorus recordings as well as dusk and night-time soundscapes with low or no bird activity adding to the overall diversity of this year's test data.</p></div>
<div><head n="3">Results</head><p>A total of 69 participants registered for the <software ContextAttributes="used">BirdCLEF</software> 2020 challenge and downloaded the dataset. Four teams succeeded in submitting runs, Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref> shows individual scores achieved by each team sorted by rank in 2020. Details of the methods and systems used in the runs are synthesized in this overview and further developed in the individual working notes of the participants. Most submitted runs scored best for the High Sierra data which has the lowest call density of all subsets (0.48 species per 5-second interval, best cmAP=0.33). The GER Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>: Scores achieved by all systems evaluated within the bird identification task of <software ContextAttributes="used">LifeCLEF</software> 2020. subset has the second highest vocal density and medium score (1.77 species per 5-second interval, best cmAP=0.21), scores for SSW are significantly lower in most runs (0.73 species per 5-second interval, best cmAP=0.18). All teams struggled with the Peruvian soundscape dataset that has a significantly higher species diversity which appears to pose a significant challenge (2.05 species per 5-second interval, best cmAP=0.07). Interestingly, the two first competitions on another Peruvian high-density soundscape dataset demonstrated the same trends (best cmAP=0.08 at <software ContextAttributes="used">BirdCLEF</software>2017 <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, best cmAP=0.12 at <software ContextAttributes="used">BirdCLEF</software>2018 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>). However, it appears that a high vocal activity alone does not suffice to predict how well a recognition system will perform. In contrast to the PER data, GER audio recordings contain species that vocalize frequently over longer periods of time which helps classifiers to identify them eventually. A high species diversity and only occasionally vocalizing species seem to prevent recognition systems from achieving higher cmAP scores.</p></div>
<div><head n="3.1">Aimarburg [21], Best run overall</head><p>Due to the restrictions of the training data, this team decided to implement a network architecture search (NAS) to cope with the diversity of the classification task. The authors argue that an optimal network architecture is vital when the use of pre-trained networks is prohibited. The authors use pre-selected 5second audio snippets from the training data as input of the neural network. Each segment was analyzed for the presence of bird sounds using the heuristic developed for the 2018 baseline system <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. A number of augmentations were applied to the data before passing it to the first layer of the network-a 1-D convolution acting as Gabor wavelet transformation. The remaining layers of the network were established by performing the NAS with a restricted search space (i.e., specific layer types and operations) and an evolutionary algorithm. A number of output heads based on recurrent layers conclude the network topology. Species lists for each recording location of the test data were used to filter the detections. The best scoring run submitted by this team achieved a cmAP of 0.128 and a rmAP of 0.193 thus being the best overall result.</p></div>

Again, preprocessed spectrograms were used as input for the network and a number of augmentations were applied to the input samples. Most notably, mixup training is used to simulate multiple birds vocalizing by overlaying samples of focal recordings. This method led to a significant improvement compared to other trials and can be considered the most important addition to the training regime. This observation is backed by other attempts in the same domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. This team managed to achieve a cmAP of 0.042 and rmAP of 0.067 with their best submission.</p></div>
<div><head n="3.3">Thailsson Clementino [7]</head><p>Triplet loss has been shown to perform well in different classification scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> and focusing on similarities instead of categories can help to cope with limited amounts of training data (which is the case for many South American bird species). This team decided to implement a Siamese network with triplet loss to generate unique features for each bird vocalization from input mel spectrograms. A kNN classifier with Euclidean distance and a multilayer perceptron acted as classification instances based on extracted feature embeddings. An AlexNet-like architecture with 5 convolutional and 3 dense layers was used to train the feature extractor that provided the best features and thus the best scoring submission. The participants achieved a cmAP of 0.063 and a rmAP of 0.108 with their (unofficial) post-deadline submission. In their working note, the authors argue that data augmentation and other variations of the triplet loss might help to improve the performance of this attempt.</p></div>
<div><head n="4">Conclusion</head><p>Passive acoustic monitoring is an important sampling tool for habitat assessmentsespecially for highly endangered environments with often extraordinarily high biodiversity. Despite the fact that automated tools for analyzing soundscape recordings are far from perfect, the manual examination and annotation of field recordings is extremely labor-intensive and often negates the benefits of acoustic monitoring compared to human point counts. Habitat loss and the destruction of critical environmental niches pose a serious threat to many species, and biodiversity assessments may only be possible for archived records of long destroyed areas. The annual <software>BirdCLEF</software> sound recognition challenge is the largest evaluation campaign that specifically aims at developing state-of-the-art classifiers to help researchers to cope with conservation challenges of our time. Deep neural networks provide good overall baselines in many domains and adapting architectures and training regimes to suit the domain of acoustic event recognition will be a major focal point of future editions. Bird sounds are an extremely diverse class of acoustic events and entering this domain has become increasingly challenging for new participants of <software ContextAttributes="created">BirdCLEF</software>. We will strive to further lower this barrier to allow more teams to develop and test their ideas so that they can contribute to this high-impact field of research.</p></div><figure xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1: Test data recording locations.
