<div><p>The growth of the semantic Web requires tools to manage data, make them available to humans and for a wide range of applications. In particular, tools dedicated to ontology management are a keystone for semantic Web applications. In this paper we consider a possibilistic framework and an evolutionary approach for ontology enrichment with OWL axioms. The assessment of candidate OWL axioms against an RDF knowledge graph requires a high computational cost, especially in terms of computation time (CPU), which may limit the applicability of the framework. To answer this problem, our contribution presented in this paper consists of (i) a multi-threading system to parallelize axiom assessment, (ii) a heuristic to avoid redundant computation and (iii) an optimization for <software>SPARQL</software> query chunking relying on an extension of the <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> 1.1 Federated Query standard.

<div><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>Over time, the semantic Web has developed significantly, relying on a series of W3C standards, the foremost of which are RDF (Resource Description Framework), <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> (<software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> Protocol and RDF Query Language) and OWL (Web Ontology Language). As a result, the use cases have diversified widely in the domains of academia, research and industry. The benefits of the semantic Web are diverse and revolve around three axes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>: interoperability between systems, notably through the addition of standards allowing the creation and distribution of knowledge graphs through the Web. These graphs are linked together when they describe the same resources or use the same vocabularies. Linked data is therefore one of the most important outcome of semantic Web technologies. The Linked Open Data (LOD) is a set of RDF knowledge graphs published and freely accessible on the Web; they are of various natures relating to many domains such as social networks, science, media, and publications. The LOD-Cloud catalog <ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">1</ref> reports that the growth in the number of integrated datasets has been steadily increasing with very significant increases between 2014 and 2017. Ontologies are the keystone of the semantic Web as they not only enable this linkage of knowledge graphs over the Web but also logical inference over knowledge graphs, i.e., the automatic deduction of implicit statements in a graph based on the axioms of ontologies.</p><p>An ontology has several definitions from both a philosophical and a computational perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>: "An ontology is a formal and explicit specification of a shared conceptualization" is a concise definition highlighting its purpose. An ontology is composed of a set of classes and a set of relations representing the concepts of the domain knowledge, a set of individuals that are instances of classes, and a set of axioms involving classes, relations and individuals and capturing domain knowledge. OWL is the semantic Web language to represent ontologies for RDF graphs.</p><p>The quality of ontologies and their enrichment are major research issues: the development of the semantic Web requires to extract ontological knowledge from the available information sources and to evaluate the quality of the constructed ontologies before using them to infer new facts. Ontology validation, quality control and enrichment are the subject of many research works <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. Ontology learning has an important place in the development of the semantic Web as it allows the enrichment of ontologies from assertions in RDF knowledge graphs of the LOD. Despite the massive development of knowledge graphs in the LOD there is a lack of rich ontologies and the quality of the available knowledge on the LOD is still an issue. For instance, although DBpedia is one of the reference knowledge graph of the LOD, constructed with information extracted from Wikipedia, its ontology is sketchy and poor in axioms. Our work fits in the field of ontology learning. We started from an evolutionary approach previously proposed to extract OWL axioms from an RDF knowledge graph <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. In this approach, the extraction of candidate axioms relies on an evolutionary algorithm and their evaluation on <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> queries to compute a score based on possibility theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Focusing on the evaluation of subsumption axioms of the form <software ContextAttributes="created">SubClassOf</software>(C, D), where C and D are class expressions, a possibility theory-based scoring involves a significant computational cost, in terms of resources and time. This limits the practical applicability of this approach. In this paper, we present three novel contributions to overcome these limitations:</p><p>A. a multi-threading system to parallelize OWL axioms assessment, especially the computation of exceptions to axioms, B. an extension of the original heuristic to avoid redundant computation, with an explanation of the computational problem, C. an optimization of <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> query chunking relying on an extension of <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> 1.1 Federated Query to automatically iterate a <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> federated query service call. In order to assess these contributions, we tested the integrity of the results and analyzed their impact in term of CPU time saving, using the previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> as a benchmark. The source <software ContextAttributes="created">code</software> of the project is available on GitHub. 2  This paper is organized as follows: In Section II we summarize the principles of the approach to extract OWL axioms from RDF data to the improvement of which we contribute. We present our contributions in Section III and the results of the experiments that we conducted to evaluate them in Section IV. We conclude in Section V.</p></div>
<div><head>II. PRELIMINARIES A. OWL SubClassOf Axioms</head><p>Six categories of OWL axioms can be distinguished: Class expression axioms (<software ContextAttributes="created">SubClassOf</software>, DisjointClasses, . . . ), Object property expression axioms (SubObjectPropertyOf, DisjointObjectProperties, . . . ), Data property expression axioms (SubDataPropertyOf, DisjointDataProperties, . . . ), Datatype definition axioms (DatatypeDefinition), Keys axioms (HasKey) and Assertion axioms (ClassAssertion, Object-PropertyAssertion). In this paper, we focus on the <software ContextAttributes="created">SubClassOf</software> class expression axiom <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. Its OWL functional-style syntax is <software ContextAttributes="created">SubClassOf</software>(C D), where C and D are OWL classes occurring in an RDF graph, e.g. dbo:Organisation, dbo:Work, dbo:Plant in the DBpedia knowledge graph with dbo the prefix denoting the DBpedia ontology namespace.</p><p>Using the SHOIQ description logic syntax, the notation C ⊑ D highlights the inclusion of C into D, i.e. the fact that instances of C are also instances of D. This is described in the direct model-theoretic semantics of OWL through the notation C I ⊆ D I where I represents individuals in a knowledge Our research area focuses on Axiom Learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, which is a bottom-up approach, using learning algorithms and relying on instances from several existing knowledge and information resources to discover axioms. Axiom learning algorithms can help reduce the overall cost of axiom extraction and ontology construction in general.</p><p>To this aim, we use an evolutionary approach, namely Grammatical Evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Using a predefined grammar in BNF format, we can generate a random set of candidate axioms, formed according to the syntax defined in the BNF file. Of course, this simple process is not sufficient to obtain an axiom that is meaningful. For this purpose, we use an evolutionary process based on this grammar to allow the generation of random candidate axioms, which together form a population, and the evaluation of this population using a fitness function, which we aim to maximise. This process, which iterates according to the given parameters, allows us to obtain from initially random candidate axioms, new candidate axioms that are more and more consistent, i.e., which present a non-zero fitness, and these individuals will be taken as models by the algorithm to generate a new population of axioms which inherit traits from the best individuals.</p><p>It is of paramount importance, for such approach to work correctly, that the fitness estimated for a candidate axiom accurately captures its compatibility with the facts asserted in the knowledge graph at hand. To this aim, we adopt am axiom evaluation heuristic, based on possibility theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, which has been shown to be particularly reliable in view of the openworld semantics of RDF knowledge graphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The heuristic computes a possibility and a necessity for a given axiom; some particular cases, like the DisjointClasses axiom, require a slightly different treatment, whereby their necessity is always zero and only their possibility is computed <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</p></div>
<div><head>C. A Possibilistic Heuristic to Evaluate SubClassOf Axioms</head><p>Taking inspiration from possibility theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, we previously proposed a possibilistic heuristic to assess <software ContextAttributes="created">SubClassOf</software> axioms with the two possibilistic metrics of possibility and necessity of an axiom <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Possibility theory is a mathematical theory of epistemic uncertainty which uses the events, variables, . . . denoted ω of a universe of discourse Ω (ω ∈ Ω) where each ω has a degree of possibility such that π : Ω → [0, 1].</p><p>In order to assess the possibility and necessity of an axiom ϕ, the heuristic considers υ + ϕ , the number of confirmations observed among the elements of υ ϕ , the support of ϕ, and υ - ϕ , the number of exceptions observed. It defines the possibility Π(ϕ) and necessity N (ϕ) of the axiom as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Π(ϕ) = 1 -1 - υ ϕ -υ - ϕ υ ϕ 2 , N (ϕ) =          1 - υ ϕ -υ + ϕ υ ϕ 2 , if Π(ϕ) = 1, 0, otherwise.</formula><p>To decide the acceptance of an axiom according to its possibility and necessity, an Acceptance/Rejection Index (ARI) is defined, combining the two measures:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">ARI(ϕ) = N (ϕ) + Π(ϕ) -1 ∈ [-1, 1].</formula><p>Thus, an ARI whose value is less than 1 indicates that there is at least 1 exception υ - ϕ for an axiom ϕ. When the ARI is equal to 0, we are in a case of total ignorance for ϕ: this indicates that υ - ϕ → ∅ and υ + ϕ → ∅. An ARI value greater than 0 implies υ - ϕ → ∅ and confirmations founded. Finally, a perfect axiom has an ARI equal to 1 and implies υ - ϕ → ∅ and</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">υ + ϕ → υ ϕ .</formula><p>The implementation of the above formulas was carried out in <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software>. The queries presented in Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref> and<ref type="figure">3</ref>. return (respectively) the number of confirmations υ + ϕ and the number of exceptions υ - ϕ for a given subsumption axiom C ⊑ D. The computation of the number of confirmations is quite simple: we count the number of instances belonging to both the subclass C and the superclass D.</p><p>On the other hand, the calculation of the number of exceptions is trickier, since, according the the open-world hypothesis, if a fact is not asserted in a knowledge base, this does not necessarily mean it is false. Therefore, an exception is assumed only when an instance of C is found to also belong in another class that does not share any instance with D. This query, which gives of course still an approximation, even though a much finer one, of the actual number of true exceptions, turns out to be computationally quite expensive.</p></div>
<div><head>SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?t) AS ?nic) WHERE {</head><p>?x a &lt;C&gt;, ?t . } Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>: <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> query used to compute the number of intersecting classes (nic) for a subclass C.</p></div>
<div><head>III. CONTRIBUTIONS A. Multi-Threading System</head><p>We implemented a multi-threading system in order to parallelize the evaluation of the axioms, which allows us to significantly reduce the overall computation time. This gain is the more significant the greater is the number of CPU cores available, since the program creates a number of SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?x) AS ?n) WHERE { ?x a &lt;C&gt;, &lt;D&gt; . } Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>: Naive implementation of our possibilistic heuristic in <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software>: retrieval of the confirmations for a given axiom <software ContextAttributes="created">SubClassOf</software>(&lt;C&gt; &lt;D&gt;). SELECT (COUNT(DISTINCT ?x) AS ?n) WHERE { ?x a &lt;C&gt;, ?t . FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?y a ?t, &lt;D&gt; . } } Fig. <ref type="figure">3</ref>: Naive implementation of our possibilistic heuristic in <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software>: retrieval of the exceptions for a given axiom <software ContextAttributes="created">SubClassOf</software>(&lt;C&gt; &lt;D&gt;).</p><p>threads equivalent to the number of cores available on the machine on which the software is run. Nevertheless, while this optimization can reduce the latency of axiom evaluation if a large number of cores is available, it does not reduce the overall cost of the task.</p></div>
<div><head>B. A Heuristic to Avoid Redundant Computation</head><p>We propose an optimization to reduce the overall computation time of the ARI of an axiom by reducing the computation time of its exceptions. Considering the naive implementation of the retrieval of the exceptions for a given axiom <software ContextAttributes="created">SubClassOf</software>(&lt;C&gt; &lt;D&gt;) in the <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> query depicted in Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>, we can observe the possible and useless repetition of the retrieval of the same types ?t for different instances ?x of a subclass &lt;C&gt; satisfying a filter condition that does not depend on ?x. And it is very likely that the same types are found many times for different individuals, implying the repetition of these same computations. As a result, we have split the <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> query to compute exceptions to an axiom in two (the latter query being dependent on the result of first one):</p><p>1) The first query retrieves, once for all, distinct types (i.e., classes) being evaluated as potentially containing exceptions to the axiom (Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>). 2) The second query retrieves the instances that belong to both subclass &lt;C&gt; and at least one of the classes retrieved bu the previous query, which suggests them to be considered as exceptions (Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref>). Additionally, considering the worst case where (almost) all the instances of subclass &lt;C&gt; are exceptions to axiom <software ContextAttributes="created">SubClassOf</software> &lt;C&gt; &lt;D&gt; (in that case the axiom's ARI will be close to -1), the computation time of exceptions may be very long if the number of instances of &lt;C&gt; is high. The computational cost of FILTER NOT EXISTS grows more than linearly with the number of instances that have to be filtered. Therefore, we have also developed a chunking technique for <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> queries in order to split the task into SELECT DISTINCT ?t WHERE { { # We retrieve the other classes of the instances of subclass &lt;C&gt;. SELECT ?t WHERE { SELECT DISTINCT ?t WHERE { ?x a &lt;C&gt; , ?t . } ORDER BY ?t } LIMIT $limit OFFSET $offset } # From these classes, we remove those sharing instances with superclass &lt;D&gt;. FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?z a ?t, &lt;D&gt; . } } Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>: Implementation of our optimized heuristic in <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software>: retrieval of the classes which instances are possible exceptions to axiom <software ContextAttributes="created">SubClassOf</software>(&lt;C&gt; &lt;D&gt;).</p><p>SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { ?x a &lt;C&gt;, ?t VALUES ?t { &lt;t1&gt; &lt;t2&gt; ... &lt;tn&gt; } } LIMIT $limit OFFSET $offset Fig. <ref type="figure">5</ref>: Implementation of our optimized heuristic in <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software>: retrieval of the exceptions of <software ContextAttributes="created">SubClassOf</software>(&lt;C&gt; &lt;D&gt;) as being the instances of the classes computed in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. several steps. The LIMIT and OFFSET modifiers allow the results of a <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> query to be paginated, making it quicker to manipulate a subset. The resulting algorithm is presented in Algorithm 2.</p></div>
<div><head>C. Optimizing the Chunking of SPARQL Queries</head><p>In general, it is quite tedious to implement chunking of <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> queries. Moreover, one may still want to resort to chunking a <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> query with a VALUES clause, due to the fact that some servers limit the number of elements handled in such a clause. Within the framework of our special use case of computing the exceptions to a <software ContextAttributes="created">SubClassOf</software> axiom, we propose a generic <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> operator allowing us to automatically integrate the pagination of the results with an iteration system. We build upon previous work on using URL parameters in <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> federated query services <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. This operator allows specifying the iteration with a URL parameter loop set to true and the pagination with a URL parameter limit set to the chosen number of first results to be returned by a query. The advantage of this operator is twofold: on the one hand, it makes it easier to <software ContextAttributes="created">code</software> the iteration and chunking of <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> queries; on the other hand, the iteration and chunking are delegated to the <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> engine, which in general is more effective at performing them than the user <software ContextAttributes="created">code</software> calling the engine several times. The algorithm of this operator is described in Algorithm 1. It is implemented into the Corese 3 semantic Web factory <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</p><p>By using this novel loop+page operator, we propose another algorithm to compute the exceptions to a <software ContextAttributes="created">SubClassOf</software> sol ← sol ∪ res 10: end for 11: return sol &lt;C&gt; &lt;D&gt;axiom. Both the query to retrieve the classes potentially containing exceptions (Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>) and the query to retrieve the exceptions (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>) are <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> federated queries using the parameters loop and limit in the URL of the remote query service in the SERVICE clause. The resulting algorithm is detailed in Algorithm 3). When compared to Algorithm 2, it is obviously less tedious to set up.</p></div>
<div><head>IV. EXPERIMENTS</head><p>In order to evaluate our contributions, we carried out the scoring of 722 candidate axioms against an RDF dataset extracted from DBpedia 3.9 comprising 463,343,966 triples and 532 OWL classes. This experiment has two objectives: on the one hand, to show that our optimizations give results that are faithful to the initial results achieved with the original heuristic presented in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and, on the other hand, to highlight the computation time savings obtained. The experiments were performed on a server equipped with an Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2637 v2 processor at 3.50GHz clock speed, with 172 GB of RAM, 1 TB of disk space running under the Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS 64-bit operating system.</p><p>As it can be seen in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">8</ref>, when using our optimization, the computation time is significantly reduced, with a maximum computation time reduced from 71,699 to 489 minutes. The ARIs values computed for each axiom remain unchanged, giving the same average ARI value (∼ -0.1936). As already reported in the experiments described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, with an ARI SELECT DISTINCT ?t WHERE { SERVICE &lt;$url/sparql?loop=true&amp;limit=$limit&gt; { SELECT DISTINCT ?t WHERE { ?x a &lt;C&gt;, ?t . } } SERVICE &lt;$url/sparql&gt; { VALUES ?t {undef} FILTER NOT EXISTS { ?z a &lt;D&gt;, ?t . } } } Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>: Second implementation of our optimized heuristic with a <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> federated query using parameters loop and limit: retrieval of the classes which instances are possible exceptions to axiom <software ContextAttributes="created">SubClassOf</software>(&lt;C&gt; &lt;D&gt;).</p><p>SELECT DISTINCT ?x WHERE { SERVICE &lt;$url/sparql?loop=true&amp;limit=$limit&gt; { ?x a &lt;C&gt;, ?t VALUES ?t { &lt;t1&gt; &lt;t2&gt; ... &lt;tn&gt; } } } Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>: Second implementation of our optimized heuristic with a <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> federated query using parameters loop and limit: retrieval of the exceptions of <software ContextAttributes="created">SubClassOf</software>(&lt;C&gt; &lt;D&gt;) as being the instances of the classes computed in Fig. <ref type="figure">6</ref>. We also compared the computation times of the ARI of each of the 722 candidate axioms when using the original heuristic or our proposed optimization. Figure <ref type="figure">9</ref> presents the initial computation time of the axioms ARIs when using the original heuristic as a function of the computation time when using our proposed optimization. This highlights the huge proportion of axioms for which our proposed optimization saves computation time and the importance of this time saving.</p><p>The average CPU computation time for evaluating an axiom is 30 minutes with our proposed optimization compared to 578 minutes with the original heuristic, with a significant average time saving of 548 minutes. For most axioms we observe a lower computation time: 593 axioms are faster to evaluate with our method, i.e. 82% of the candidate axioms tested. In particular, our optimization solves the problem of extremely long CPU computation times for some axioms (see Figure see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">8a</ref>, up to 71,699 minutes). Our optimisation significantly reduced the computational cost to a maximum value of 489 minutes, a reduction by a factor of approximately 150. For 129 axioms, i.e. 18% of the tested candidate axioms, we observe a higher computation time with our optimization. This occurs for axioms where the instances of &lt;C&gt; do not share any of their other types. In that case, the execution of the initial single <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> query (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>) is faster than the Fig. <ref type="figure">9</ref>: Comparison of the computation times (CPU) of axioms ARIs with the original heuristic and with our proposed optimization (A+B), highlighting the proportion of axioms for which our optimization saves time (in green) or loose time (in red). Both axes are logarithmic. execution of the two <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> queries in our optimisation (Figures <ref type="figure">6</ref> and<ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">7</ref>). However, the results show an average increase in computation time of about 57 minutes and a maximum increase of 244 minutes for these axioms. These are much smaller losses compared to the average and maximum gain we get on the other 82% candidate axioms.</p><p>To evaluate our last optimization using a loop+page operator relying on the extension of <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> federated query with URL parameters, we compared the times to compute axioms ARIs with this extension and with standard <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> queries. The results presented in Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">10</ref> highlight a significant CPU time saved when using <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> federated queries with URL parameters. The average computation time for an axiom is reduced by approximately 12 minutes. There are 683 axioms quicker to assess using the loop operator and only 39 axioms for which there is a minor increase of the computation time. This observed loss of time is explained by a significant accumulation of HTTP requests submitted to the server in the case where the potential exceptions have a high number of types. This accumulation increases, even more, when several axioms are evaluated simultaneously (contrib. A). A large number of HTTP requests can increase server latency, however, we can see that these time losses are marginal. This suggests that the implementation of this operator optimises the chunking of queries internally, making the computation cost less important than our first proposal, in which we truncate the queries (see Algorithm 2).</p></div>
<div><head>V. CONCLUSION</head><p>We presented an optimisation of a possibilistic heuristic approach for the assessment of OWL <software>SubClassOf</software> axioms against RDF data, enabling a significant CPU computation time saving and offering new perspectives to this approach. Our contribution lies in the proposition and the combination of a multi-threading system and two algorithms to compute the exceptions to candidate <software ContextAttributes="created">SubClassOf</software> axioms: a first one relying on a classical approach for <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> query chunking and a second one where we put forward our expertise with the Corese semantic Web factory to propose a loop+page operator implemented with URL parameters for <software ContextAttributes="created">SPARQL</software> federated queries.</p><p>As future work, we plan to adapt the proposed optimizations to the evaluation of other types of OWL axioms.
